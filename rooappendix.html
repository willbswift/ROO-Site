			<h2>TRIBUTE TO CRAIG HINTON</h2>
			<p>
				<span class="A-fanon">While I hesitate to call Craig a close friend (we hadn’t done more then debate continuity for over a year) I was
					very sad to learn of his death. For me Craig was: </span>
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<span class="A-fanon">An Idol: He routinely did what I only dreamed of – wrote Doctor Who novels. And he was friends with people like
						Andy Lane, Justin Richards, and Gary Russell and if that isn’t sitting among the gods I don't know what is. </span>
				</li>
				<li>
					<span class="A-fanon">A Friend: He cheered me up when I was down and vice versa. He mention my wife and me in the text and the acknowledgments
						of “Synthespians[TM].” And for a few mad weeks we were both planning on attending each others weddings!</span>
				</li>
				<li>
					<span class="A-fanon">A Mentor: He proof read my early drafts of the
						<a href="https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B6zjenFzzQn1MF9xeHNNS1M1akU/edit?pli=1">TARDIS Technical Index</a> and told me that it should be something better and nicer then just another page on my rather
						sloppy website. </span>
				</li>
				<li>
					<span class="A-fanon">An Advocate: He had several conversations with Justin Richards of BBC Books about getting the TARDIS Technical Index
						published. </span>
				</li>
				<li>
					<span class="A-fanon">A Writing Partner: I test read and offered suggestions for “Excelis Decays.”The fact that he took many of
						these suggestions to heart gave me some small chance to affect the creation of licensed Dr. Who direction – something
						which will always be a high point in my life.</span>
