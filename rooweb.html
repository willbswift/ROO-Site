				<span class="A-tv">The Eye was stabilized in an eternally dynamic equation against the mass of the planet Gallifrey.

				<span class="A-audiobook">The name Panopticon is derived from the Eye's ability to observer and 'see' all of space and time.<br> </span>

				<span class="A-tv">Rassilon also created the ebonite rod known as the Rod of Rassilon (sometimes </span>

				<span class="A-audiobook">The Caldera itself can be reached via the Vaults found beneath the Capitol. The Security Codes needed to enter the Caldera
					change every micro-span. If a lesser species was to enter the Caldera they would be killed.
					<span class="A-notbbc">Indeed, due to density of strands in the Web of Time </span>

							cease to exist here and anyone with a high enough
							<span class="A-fanon">reality quotient and</span> willpower can have god-like powers. </span> Outside the Event-Horizon of the spinning
						star is an area called the Ergosphere. In this area energy that escapes the singularity’s gravity is accelerated
						and amplified to almost infinite levels. Rassilon surrounded the Ergosphere with an iron sphere 10 kilometers in diameter.
						</span>
				</span>
				<span class="A-audiobook">Iron was used because a ridged material is necessary to prevent waves of gravitational energy from causing malfunctions
					in nearby systems. </span>
				<span class="A-tv">
					<span class="A-audiobook">This sphere was mirrored on the inside. Rassilon allowed a light beam to enter the sphere. This light was amplified
						by the singularity’s Ergosphere, reflected off the mirrored sphere, was amplified again, and so on. Each time
						the light beam gained energy. A small hole at the top of the sphere releases the amplified light beam. Using
						<span class="A-game">Rassilon's discovery that </span>
						<span class="A-tv">E = MC cubed in the

						<span class="A-game">Using trans-dimensional physics
							<span class="A-audiobook">Rassilon surrounded the Eye with a transduction barrier. This </span>
						</span>shifted the Eye slightly into the future
						<span class="A-game">turning it inside out through the 5th dimension. </span>

temporal paradoxes associated with Inner Time can cause fluctuations in
the artron power output of the Eye of Harmony, enough to endanger
TARDIS travel. &nbsp;It doesn’t take much of a weakness of the power
output of the Eye to disable almost all of Gallifrey’s defenses
(including the Validium).&nbsp;Even the transduction barrier would
begin to fail. The Eye of Harmony can be drained remotely with a
stellar manipulator. But the manipulator would need to be in continual
operation to disable all of Gallifrey’s time travel facilities. </span>
