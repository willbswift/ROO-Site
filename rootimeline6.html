			<h2>THE HISTORY OF THE TIME LORDS PART VI: PRE-WAR GALLIFREY</h2>
			<div class="section">
				<p>
					<span class="A-fanon">This Time Line covers the period from the 1996 TV Movie, to the beginning of the Time War. It is set 2,000,000 years
						after Rassilon assumes power on Gallifrey. All dates are given in Gallifreyan years (which are the same as Earth years)
						and are based off the age of the Doctor. </span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span class="A-fanon">Once the Eye of Harmony is anchored, time began moving at a different speed on Gallifrey then the rest of the Universe.
						The Doctor was born around March 30th, 1213 AD and when Greyjan had served one year as President of Gallifrey (and
						the Doctor was 753), the Earth date was 1752 AD. This problem was probably corrected when the Nine Homeworlds project
						was undertaken. </span>

			<h2>Return from the Post War Era</h2>
			<p>
				<span class="A-fanon">It
is my belief that, after the events of The Gallifrey Chronicles, the
Doctor traveled back to the Gallifrey Relative Time where he first left
the pre-war era (i.e. when he was 1018 years old). He then enlisted the
aid of the Time Lords of the Original Gallifrey to create a new
Gallifrey as part of the 9 Homeworlds Project. This Gallifrey saw the
resurrection of the Master (or the Magistrate as he will be known), and
possibly Hedin. <br>
					<br> It is unclear how many of his memories were regained from Compassion. It is possible that he deleted (or had blocked)
					the memories of his own experiences from the Post Time War Era and the fall of Gallifrey I. Certainly he never mentions
					them in subsequent stories, and this could explain his believing that he is only 900 years old. For the purposes of
					this timeline I will NOT be counting the 114 years and 9 months he spent in the Post War Era, nor the months of wandering
					that proceeded it.

					as a decoy in its place. Such a move could have had a large (but unknown) effect on the History of the Spiral Politic.
					Officially each cloneworld is occupied by caretaker-Houses but since communication and travel between them is forbidden
					each one believes itself to be the original Gallifrey and each has it's own Lord or Lady President. </span>

				<span class="A-fanon">As part of the defense mechanisms these other Gallifreys appear not be connected with the Protocols of Linearity (aka
					the 3rd Law of Time). Indeed it is possible that a new Law of Time was passed to prevent each Gallifrey's causal nexus
					from interacting directly with the others. This would mean that any enemy who engaged one of the cloneworlds who then
					be trapped by the Protocols of Linearity making it very difficult for them to mount an attack on any other Gallifrey
					(or their agents). Any Time Lord who survived their Gallifrey's destruction would only be able to visit worlds which
					either had no connection with the War or worlds where it was believed that Gallifrey had fallen. Effectively they would
					be stranded in the Post Time War era. This is exactly what we see in the 8th Doctor after The Ancestor Cell. Though
					the 8th Doctor was able to get back into the Pre-Time War era, both after the events of Taking of Planet 5 and again

			<h2>Notes on the Placement of The Infinity Doctors</h2>
			<span class="A-fanon">
				<b>Explanation of analysis for this placement: </b>
			</span>
			<p>
				<span class="A-fanon">I postulate that The Infinity Doctors occurs after the Doctor uses the Matrix to found New Gallifrey on one of the Gallifrey
					Cloneworlds. (so sometime after the story "The Gallifrey Chronicles") </span>
				</p><ul>
					<li>
						<span class="A-fanon">Hedin's death in Arc of Infinity is the only real contradiction with this placement. However according to Lance Parkin
							(author of TID) the Hedin seen in the novel is the son of another councilor who was also named Hedin. This is also
							hinted at in the book ("[Hedin] was an historian, a mainstay of the High Council, as his father had been before him"
							pg. 27). And the comment (on pg. 157) "A Hedin was still a Hedin" both support this idea. </span>
					</li>
					<li>
						<span class="A-fanon">The Doctor is between 1011-1295 </span>
					</li>
					<li>
						<span class="A-fanon">Lance has indicated that TID does not, in his opinion, take place after "The Gallifrey Chronicles" but Lance has also
							stated that he intended fains fans should place the story where they feel it fits best - so this placement is still
							consistent with authorial intention. </span>
					</li>
					<li>
						<span class="A-fanon">Also Larna's appearance in "Unnatural History" might be out of sync. She is probably taking a field internship as part
							of her academy training (this would be before she met the Doctor). Larna certainly doesn't act like she knows him.
							On the other hand maybe the meeting IS out of sync. She might be working on repairing the Effect. The Doctor IS very
							reluctant to contact Joyce and Larna. He might realize that they're out of sync. Maybe Larna's lack of interest is
							because she realizes he's out of sync and is trying to avoid a paradox. </span>

After his death on Drornid the Doctor was resurrected in the City of

founded during the 6th Doctor's era). But why would he quote the age of
his 6th incarnation [even if that was the Gallifrey Relative Time he
was currently existing in] if he was going to ensure that all his
