				<h2>RELIGON AND MYTHOLGY</h2>
				<div class="section">
					<span class="A-audiobook">Since Gallifreyans are never born, never
						<span class="A-fanon">learn like </span>children, and almost never die, their understanding of mythology and fairy-tales is limited. </span>
					<span class="A-licensed">To
them myths are only valuable as a way of symbolically teaching morals.
The human concepts of denial and schadenfreude have no equivalents in
Gallifreyan language. </span>
					<span class="A-notbbc">It wasn't till millions of years after the creation of the Eye of Harmony that they invented post-modernism. </span>
					<span class="A-audiobook"><br><br>The Book of Rassilon is a Time Lord religious text that the Other might have helped write. It starts with the words
						"In the Beginning..."&nbsp;</span><span class="A-alternate"></span><span class="A-audiobook">Old Time legends and Gallifreyan mythology states that the Universe was born from a sentient singularity called Eru
						or the Great Old One Azathoth. At the Big Bang the being split into 10 dimensions (the Universe has 11 dimensions).
						After Event 0 the Mother Goddess used the
						<span class="A-alternate">Aurora Temporalis (Anvils of Heaven) to create</span> and pour Time itself into the void of the empty Universe. </span>
					<span class="A-audiobook">The ratio 1 to 812 is key to understanding the 12 dimensional nature of quantum string theory. When the Time Lords discovered
						this ratio, many of the populace saw it a conclusive proof of the existence of the old Gods. But just as many saw it
						as conclusive proof that the gods could never exist. </span><span class="A-alternate">In the modern era Gallifreyans do believe that the ordered complexity of the universe points unquestionably to the existence
						of a creator. This creator's power takes the form of gravity when viewed from 3 dimensions. </span>
					<span class="A-alternate">But&nbsp;</span><span class="A-audiobook">(with the exception of some Shobogan cults)&nbsp;</span><span class="A-alternate">no Gallifreyans worship either Azathoth or the Mother Goddess, nor do they do call them "Gods."<br><br> </span>
				</div>
				
				<div class="section">
					<span class="A-audiobook">The
primary Gallifreyan Gods are the Eternals known as the Menti Celesti who have been worshiped
since the Old Time. The Menti Celesti are made up of Pain, Death, and
Time (the granddaughter of the Timewyrm). It was said that Pain was the
oldest of the gods, with Time being the youngest. Other gods include
Light, Life,&nbsp;<span class="A-notbbc">Fate, <span class="A-fanon">and Hope.</span></span> The Gallifreyan Gods have the following colors
attributed to them: Red and Black for Pain, White for Death, and a
shifting Gray color for Time. The ancient symbol of Death is a red
circle called a Regenerative Circle. </span><span class="A-audiobook">The Time Lords believe these Gods to be Higher Eternals </span>
					<span class="A-notbbc">but in reality they are part of the essence of the Universe. </span>
					<span class="A-audiobook">They are abstract universal conceptual entities, non-corporeal beings that can control time, and fate.
						<span class="A-notbbc">These
conceptual Loa were brought into existance by the sapient being who
conceived of Death, and Time and the others as entities with their own
will. </span> Death, Time, and Pain might be the dreams of Time Lords which leak out into the cosmos.
						Time Lords in nightmares or near-death states sometimes make deals with them, sometimes to become their Champions.
						Death serves as a gatekeeper between Null-Space and the afterlife
						<span class="A-fanon">(the City of the Saved??). </span>
					</span>
					<span class="A-audiobook">Like, all of the Transcendental Beings, the Eternals are bound by the Great and Ancient Covenants. Most of the Higher
						Eternals believe they have a responsibility to those who worship them, and try to live up to their expectations. But
						some focus on their own agendas.</span>
					<span class="A-licensed">By the time of the Doctor, many Time Lords will see the Eternals as little more the legends. </span>
					<span class="A-audiobook">Despite this, about 25% of the population of Gallifrey worships Death, Time, Pain etc.
						<span class="A-fanon">Many Childeren recite prayers to the Time and her Sisters. </span>Prayer to the gods is usually conducted by individuals
						in a privet setting. </span>
					<span class="A-audiobook"></span><span class="A-audiobook"><br><br> </span>
				</div>
				<div class="section">
					<span class="A-audiobook">The religious institution of Gallifrey originally included the
						<span class="A-notbbc">Black Council of </span>Cardinals, Priests,
						<span class="A-tv"> Monks,</span> and Wardens of the Church - all led by the Supreme Pontiff of Time (the Time Pope). </span>
					<span class="A-notbbc">Shortly after the anchoring of the Eye of Harmony </span>
					<span class="A-audiobook">(several thousands of years before the Doctor) Gallifreyan law was changed so that Gallifreyan Religious Class no longer
						had access to Time Travel, Time Lord genetic benefits, and could not serve on the Supreme Council. The High Council
						had the monasteries dissolved. There was no violence involved in these reforms but the leaders of the church became
						little more than figure heads. The position of the Supreme Pontiff of Time (the Time Pope) and other lower ranking
						Cardinals remained, but they had no real powers. The position of Time Pope was finally abolished during the Doctor's
						exile to the Earth.<br><br></span><span class="A-alternate">Early in their history the Gallifreyans came to believe that if they killed all the evil people in the universe then
						the good people who remained would become evil. Light can not exist without darkness. If evil were destroyed then good
						would vanish as well. </span>
					<span class="A-audiobook">In the modern era, The philosophers of Gallifrey realize that all life relies on the death of others, and they have
						no answer for horror of that truth. </span>
					<span class="A-game">As Lords of Time, many see themselves as being above conventional mortality. </span>
					<span class="A-audiobook">Indeed, most Time Lords consider notions of good and evil to outdated, archaic, redundant, or even incomprehensible.
						And sin is not a concepts that can be found in Gallifreyan culture. </span>
					<span class="A-tv">Damaging History is about as close to evil as Gallifreyan culture gets. </span>
					<span class="A-game">Other Gallifreyans (including the Doctor) believe in The Great Moral Dialectic. It states that </span><span class="A-game">as the physical Universes keeps expanding, </span><span class="A-tv">the Moral Universe continually refines itself towards goodness to maintain balance with evil.&nbsp;</span><span class="A-audiobook">According to Gallifreyan science, the only thing that can stand against entropy and random decay is Life. Reality leads
						to complexity, which leads to life, which leads to civilization, which leads to ethics. </span>
					<span class="A-game">This will lead to the ultimate superiority of Good over Evil.</span><br><br><span class="A-audiobook">Time Lords have also been known to mention a Devil from time to time. The Time Lord mythology speaks of the Dark God
						Valdemar who was destroy by the Old Ones. The battle to achieve this took centuries and is regarded as the biggest
						war in Gallifreyan mythology. Following this all of the Old Ones vanished, and this is considered to be the 6th Greatest
						mystery in the history of the Universe.</span><br><span class="A-audiobook"><br> </span>
				</div>
				<div class="section">
					<span class="A-audiobook">The Omniscate has been seen as an almost magical symbol for warding off evil and is placed on rooms and objects of great
						power. There is a Gallifreyan charm that, when stated, is supposed to bring good luck. </span>

					<span class="A-audiobook">it was formalized by the founding of the 6 Chapters by the 6 great heroes of the Time of Legend. This number will be
						reflected in their architecture, social structures, mythology, and art. </span>
					<span class="A-tv"> Most Time Lords consider the six segments of the Key to Time to be a myth. The number 13 is important as well (stemming

					<div class="section">
						<span class="A-audiobook">Gallifreyans
use 208 language tenses to aid in discussing the complexities of time
travel. Because of the stagnation of their society Gallifreyans have
difficulty handling different cultures. They have 30 different words to
describe culture shock. <span class="A-licensed">The human concept of denial and schadenfreude had no equivalents in Gallifreyan language. </span>The language's structure and syntax is such that it sounds like a rhyming poem or song. <span class="A-tv">The
term "Time Lord" is technically masculine but, in the modern era, it is
often used by both male and females. The title "Time Lady" is rarely
used and considered to be old fashioned. </span>The plural of TARDIS is still still debated by Time Lords. </span>
						<span class="A-tv">Many (if not all) Time Lord documents are printed on circular colored paper. Sometimes these are rolled up into scrolls.
							<span class="A-audiobook">It should be noted that using green ink to write was considered to be very bad manners. </span><br><br>Gallifreyan Morse (similar to Morse Code), is easy to translate,</span>
						<span class="A-audiobook">Rassilon's Cipher is very difficult to decode and only a few Time Lords are trained to understand it.
							<span class="A-tv">Rassilon's

								<span class="A-audiobook">"Zagreus
sits inside your head / Zagreus lives among the dead / Zagreus sees you
in your bed / and eats you when you're sleeping / Zagreus at the end of
days / Zagreus lies all other ways / Zagreus comes when time's a maze /
and all of history's weeping / Zagreus taking time apart. / Zagreus
fears the hero heart. / Zagreus seeks the final part. / the reward that
he is reaping. / Zagreus sings when all is lost / Zagreus takes all
those he's crossed / Zagreus wins and all is cost / the hero's hearts
he's keeping. / Zagreus seeks the hero's ship / Zagreus needs the web
to rip / Zagreus sups time at a drip / and life aside, he's sweeping.
/...(The hero leaves his home to find the land of dreams where Zagreus
lives) (there is a part that describes people disappearing up a
paradoxical staircase).../ And he set then his course / To a scar on
the face of Creation / Where the stars lived and died in the churn of
one night / Where the mountains might move in the blink of an eye / And
decay was the only true constant / ...(the Hero spends many years
searching before)... / And the gate of Zagreus opened before him / And
all of the Antiverse was revealed to him / And its terrible beauty
ached in his hearts / So through them he ventured / There to do battle
with Zagreus, the Beast / Never resting as long as history is lasting /
Until either or both are laid to waste / Zagreus waits at the end of
the world / for Zagreus is the end of the world / his time is the end
of time / and his moment time's undoing" - Nursery Rhyme. Legends of
Zagreus can be found on a 1000 different worlds. These so-called Books
of Zagreus were created by the Neverpeople to trick the leaders of
Gallifrey into entering the Anti Time Universe. </span>
