brains are green in color <span class="A-tv">and
larger then a human's.</span>
&nbsp;The brain is divided into two hemispheres.&nbsp; One side is the
seat of reason, known as the brain proper.&nbsp; The other is the seat
of imagination, know as the mind.&nbsp;&nbsp;There is an interface
connecting these two hemispheres, and at that point things can exist
purely as concepts without corporeal form. &nbsp;</span></span><span class="A-audiobook"><span class="A-tv"><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They have Superganglion</span> which allows them to
re-order, re-rout and re-program their neural pathways at will.&nbsp; Among
other things this <span class="A-game">bio-rhythmic control</span> allows them to </span><span class="A-audiobook">separate the operation of the two
hemispheres of their brains</span><span class="A-audiobook"><span class="A-audiobook">, greatly boosting their ability to multitask. &nbsp;</span>They
can
bypass comprimised areas of their brains and switch off the parts of their brain that process input from
various senses, allowing them to limit their vast number of senses to
the same range as a human. &nbsp;Through an act of will, a Gallifreyan
can compartmentalize pain to the degree that they can block the pain
from a severed limb. &nbsp;</span><span class="A-audiobook"><span class="A-fanon">This makes&nbsp;</span><span class="A-tv">them immune to some types of
interrogation technology. &nbsp;</span></span><span class="A-audiobook">They have the ability to shut down the right or left side of their body. &nbsp;<span class="A-tv">They can lower their need for oxygen, and even control their heart beats to send messages. &nbsp;</span>They can <span class="A-fanon">also use this versitily to</span> destroy crystaline structures that might invade their nervous system. &nbsp;</span><span class="A-audiobook"><span class="A-tv"><span class="A-audiobook"><span class="A-fanon">One of the side effects of this is that</span> <span class="A-tv">21st century Cybermen are incapable on cyber-converting a Gallifreyan.&nbsp; </span>Depending on how

induce anxiety. &nbsp;</span></span><span class="A-audiobook">The Epiphysis

allow them to sense higher dimensions (with training). </span><span class="A-audiobook"><span class="A-tv"></span></span><span class="A-audiobook"><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the
base of their brains is a seperate tertiary lobe
called <span class="A-tv">the Autonomic Brain that handles all body
and motor functions. <span class="A-audiobook">&nbsp;</span></span></span><span class="A-audiobook">A Gallifreyan&#8217;s autonomic brain
is like a helper mind that can be told to do and monitor simple things
while the main consciousness thinks about other things.&nbsp; It can even
send non-descriptive alerts to the mind. &nbsp;</span><span class="A-audiobook">By volunterly reducing the activity of this third lobe to a vegatative state, a Gallifreyan can use a </span><span class="A-audiobook">nerve cluster
of </span><span class="A-audiobook">major ganglion to&nbsp;</span><span class="A-audiobook">take direct control over their metabolism. &nbsp;This nerve cluster is located</span><span class="A-audiobook">&nbsp;</span><span class="A-audiobook"> </span><span class="A-audiobook">along their left collar bone </span><span class="A-audiobook">beneath</span><span class="A-audiobook"> the </span><span class="A-audiobook">left clavicle. &nbsp;With sustained concentration Gallifreyans can send messages to the parts of their
autonomic brain that controls various systems (like the circulatory
system).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This allows them to consciously
modulate and control the details off that system. &nbsp;<span class="A-game">They can double the pace of their body's functions if nessecary. </span>&nbsp;Unfortunately a blow at this&nbsp;</span><span class="A-audiobook">at this cluster will render
them unconscious. &nbsp;<br></span><span class="A-audiobook">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These systems frees the rest of the brain for
purely intellectual pursuits, allowing them to think of over 7,432 ideas
in a few minutes and acheive mental calculations beyond that of most sapient species. &nbsp;<span class="A-tv">If these basic body function are being handeled by an external life-support system then Gallifreyans are even capable of <span class="A-audiobook">reprogramming</span> their autonomic brain for more complex processes, such as conciousness and communications. &nbsp;</span></span><span class="A-audiobook"><span class="A-licensed">An
electroencephalograph of a Gallifreyan brain will show a type of
activity unlike any human brain.&nbsp;</span> While human alpha waves
are generated by the occipital lobe, Gallifreyan Alpha Waves are
generated by the hypothalamus.&nbsp; If all other forms of
communcation have been disabled they can communicate via
reduced-frequency alpha waves. &nbsp;</span><span class="A-audiobook"><span class="A-tv">They are

Gallifreyan recall memories that he hasn't accessed for several
centuries. &nbsp;Gallifreyans can check their own minds for dead spots
in there memory to tell if there&#8217;s any damage to their brain. &nbsp;</span><span class="A-audiobook">Unfortunately, because of their artificially extended
life span,
Gallifreyans need to clear out some of their memories every few
thousand years.&nbsp; They usually store the more important memories

discovered the secret of temporal fission and set the Eye of Harmony an
eternal dynamic equation balanced against the mass of Gallifrey.&nbsp;</span> <span class="A-audiobook">With the creation the Eye of Harmony Rassilon and the Other formatted the Astral Vortex (the 5th Dimension) </span>at the moment of Event 1, creating the Space-Time Vortex.&nbsp; This act was an essential event, as <span class="A-audiobook">earlier
Gallifreyan researchers, and other higher evolutionaries had been
accessing the Astral Vortex since the beginning of time.&nbsp; </span>The
fact that the Time Lords had already been using the Vortex before they
created it was seen as proof that Time Lord culture is the literal
center of the Universe. &nbsp;The
construction of the Vortex is a feat worthy of a Level 11 Society, but
Rassilon will keep much of this technology to himself.&nbsp; The rest
of the Time Lords will remain a Level 10 society.&nbsp; <br><span class="A-audiobook">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unlike the first four dimensions, the fifth
dimension is collapsed and folded into a time spiral the size of an
atom.&nbsp; Since the Fifth Dimension touches the first four dimensions
of Normal Space, <span class="A-tv">the Vortex encompasses all universes. </span>All matter, energy, and even darkness are blended into one ever shifting time spiral.&nbsp; <span class="A-game">The Vortex became a dimension of pure thought with a complexity that borders on sentience </span><span class="A-notbbc">(in fact the Faction Paradox believe that it is sentient and refer to it the Loa).&nbsp; </span>The
axis of the Vortex is a vast transdimensional Time Spiral that
encompasses the universe and serves as a foundation for all points in
space and time. <span class="A-game">&nbsp;The tightest coils is the future, and the widest loops are the past. &nbsp;</span><span class="A-tv"></span></span></span><span class="A-audiobook"><span class="A-audiobook">The Eye serves as an anchor

This nexus can be accessed with the Spiral Chamber.&nbsp; </span></span><span class="A-game"><span class="A-audiobook"><span class="A-tv">When plotted out in three dimensions the Vortex is usually depicted as a glittering blue void <span class="A-audiobook">with gold highlights.&nbsp;</span> But it can look like any of the opening sequences of Doctor Who.

dangers include quantum mirages, substrate diversions in the Vortex,
and crossing the Time Spiral boundary.&nbsp; It is also possible (but
very rare) for a TARDIS to become trapped in a fractional dimension
between the Vortex and N-Space.&nbsp; If a TARDIS was to be trapped
between a Vortex Rupture and a Subspace Infarction it would break up. T<span class="A-tv">here
are also uncharted areas of the Space/Time Vortex. The Mandragora Helix
inhabits one such area. The Mandragora Helix is a spiral of pure energy
radiating outwards in ways the Time Lords don't fully understand. This

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But the Vortex is not just a danger to a
TARDIS.&nbsp; A TARDIS is also a danger to the Vortex. <span class="A-audiobook">A

A minor oldblood House that produced most of Gallifrey&#8217;s generals, enforcers, and strategists.&nbsp; Its
cousins are known for being aggressive and ruthless defenders of the Laws of Time.&nbsp; They have nothing but disdain for the Lesser Species. Their Loom was known for being particularly versatile.

regenerations where the body was changed but not the brain,
regenerations that turned the subject inside out, regenerations that
reverted the Gallifreyan into a time-tot and other monsterous
variations. &nbsp;Also within this house the Black Nurseries hold mutated
and paradoxical children (including those who over 20 years old).
&nbsp;The advances in Gallifreyan science over the last several thousand years have almost completely elimited such problems</span><span class="A-audiobook">, and there is no evidence that the Shadow House ever existed. &nbsp;</span><span class="A-audiobook">However
the Doctor felt that that it almost

to find the date in the Humanian Era dating one would use the following equation... </span><br class="A-fanon"><span class="A-fanon">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; GRT = .00028 DrAge^2 +.505*DrAge + 1213.25 (or 1214.25 for ages before -1213.25). &nbsp;</span><br class="A-fanon"><span class="A-fanon">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
A simple way to roughly estimate Earth dates in the Doctor's life can
be found using GRT = .61*DrAge + 1213.25</span><br class="A-fanon"><span class="A-fanon">&nbsp; &nbsp; At some point
(probably at the time of the Nine Homeworlds Project) this system was
changed. &nbsp;This might have been caused by shifting Gallifrey's
system into a new Time Zone. &nbsp;Whatever the cause it is known that
the end of the Last Time War was well before 2596 AD. &nbsp;</span>

Rassilon created the Eye of Harmony. &nbsp;According to the FASA RPG
this happened 23 years after Omega's death.</span>&nbsp; According to "Christmas on a Rational Planet" this happend around 3,500,000,000 BC. &nbsp;<span class="A-fanon"><br></span><span class="A-fanon">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class="A-fanon">Time moves at a different speed on Gallifrey then the rest of the

The mystery of the Morbius Doctors is a tricky problem.&nbsp; They
appear to exist before the Doctor left Gallifrey, and yet the Doctor
and most (if not all) Time Lords reguard the Hartnell Doctor as the
Doctor's first body.&nbsp; It is know that the Doctor was married to
Patience for much of time he spent in these lost incarnations, and that both he and his sons served on
the
High Council.&nbsp; It is also known that the&nbsp;Doctor had not regenerated and
had no interested in romance when he turned 200 at the Academy.&nbsp;
In order to get married and have a son that served on the high Council
it would seem likely that the Doctor would be at least 330 when he was
in the Camfield body.&nbsp; However the Doctor's leaving Gallifrey
would have had to occur at this point.&nbsp; For now I'm
assuming that the Morbuis Doctor's were a reincarnation of the Other
that occured shortly before the birth of the Hartnell
Doctor.&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class="A-fanon">He
married </span><span class="A-fanon">Patience,</span><span class="A-fanon"> raised a family and the Doctor

authorizes a reconnaissance mission to</span><span class="A-audiobook"> the Shoal at the edge of the
Stellian
Galaxy (30,000 lightyears from Gallifrey) - which until recently was
believed by the Time Lords to be
uninhabited by life of any sort.&nbsp; The Time Lords fear that the
Enemy from the Last Great Time War might be hiding there.&nbsp;
Castellan Marnal bribes the duty officer at traffic control and leads a
crazy
crusade of three TARDISes to the Shoal.&nbsp; At this point Marnal is
in his 12th body and has white hair and a large nose.&nbsp; </span><span class="A-audiobook">Marnal fails because he attacks
without knowing enough
about the
enemy.&nbsp; Marnal's
attack on the Vore and destruction of the Temporal Cicatrix Scar alters
history.&nbsp; This Cicatrix was form by a naked singularity 300 years
before Marnal's attack.&nbsp; In the
original version of History the Vore evolved to become an advanced
sentient
race.&nbsp; In the new version they swarm across the Stellian Galaxy as
an aggressive non-sentient species.&nbsp; </span><span class="A-audiobook">Ulysses, Penelope,&nbsp; Mr. </span><span class="A-audiobook">Saaldamir</span><span class="A-audiobook">, and Larna confront Marnal upon his
return and threaten to
reveal his atrocity.&nbsp; Marnal threatens to reveal the truth about
Ulysses' son.&nbsp; Ulysses has Marnal's memory deleted, steals his
Type 40 TARDIS (which will eventually become the Doctor's) and dumps
Marnal in England in 1883 AD under the care of Penelope's mother.&nbsp;
A Matrix Projection predicts that the Vore
and the Time Lords will have a final battle in which 20-40% of the
population of Gallifrey will die.&nbsp; The Time Lords conclude that
the Vore might become the enemy that will destroy their species and
mark the contact with this species as a possible Last Contact.&nbsp;
The Supreme Council orders that all Time Lords are to maintain an
exclusion zone of one parsec and 100 years from any Vore moon.&nbsp;
The phrase "Marnal's Error" means to attack without understanding your
enemy.&nbsp; </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;"></span><br>

catabolism is a metabolic reaction which usually occurs when the body

more complex substances (such as muscle) to generate ATP&nbsp; which in
turn produces a high-energy charge used for other metabolic processes
such as anabolism. A severe catabolism could cover anything from loss
of bone density to reduced organic function. Presumably we are talking
about a brain catabolism, ie. the conversion of brain tissue into ATP.<br><br></span><span class="A-audiobook"><span class="A-licensed">??&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After
centuries of debate on what to do with the cargo of the Consolidator it
was decided that the station should be sent through a time rift into
Gallifrey&#8217;s distant future so that future generations of Time Lords to
decide its fate.&nbsp; But not even the most senior Time Lords could
generate a time rift large enough to hold the Consolidator.&nbsp;
Eventually the Doctor and Master, two of the Academy&#8217;s most promising
graduates, were asked to find a solution.&nbsp; After a great deal of
work the Doctor pronounced the problem insolvable, but the Master had a
sudden flash of insight that allowed him to see the true nature of time
in a way that his peers had never conceived of.&nbsp; He realizes that
the collapse of a super massive star would create the necessary charge,
angular momentum, and Hawking temperature to forge a stable time
corridor.&nbsp; The Master offered the Doctor the chance to share
credit for his discovery the Doctor refused, believing that the Time
Lords were behaving irresponsibly by pawning the Consolidator off on
future generations.&nbsp; The High Council approved the Master&#8217;s plan

<p><br><br><span class="A-fanon">
This Time Line covers the life of the Doctor from the end of the
Classic TV Series and most of the novels. It ranges from his 6th
Regeneration to the beginning of the Time War. The numbers are based
off the birth/age of the Doctor. <br> Time moves at a different speed
on Gallifrey then the rest of the Universe. The Doctor was born
around March 30th, 1213 AD and when Greyjan had served one year as
President of Gallifrey (and the Doctor was 753), the Earth date was
1752 AD.  And the differential isn't constant, but is slowing by
about 1 second every hour (so about 1 year for ever 3,600 years). <br><br></span>

Thoughts on taking over the Universe:&nbsp; The Master appears to be
attempting to change history in almost all of his stories. &nbsp; But
the
Doctor's TARDIS is boosting local temporal inertia to the point where
he can't succeed.&nbsp; With each battle the Master assumes that he's
managed
to
reduce the inertia (or boost his own reality quotient) enough to affect
History.&nbsp; And each time the Doctor's TARDIS compensates to the
point
where the Doctor wins.&nbsp; If so then the Master probably plays merry
hell
with history whenever the Doctor (or some other Time Lord) isn't
present.&nbsp; Any time his plot failed he could just nip back in time
and
alter things so he would succeed.&nbsp; This would explain how he could
be so
incredibly dangerous and yet have such a difficult time dealing with
the Doctor's interference</span></span><span class="A-tv"><span class="A-fanon">.&nbsp;&nbsp; The ONLY time the
Master even has a chance to fail would be when another Time Lord with a
TARDIS shows up to stop him. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another Thought: The
Master might somehow know that the Doctor's death would damage the Web
of Time.&nbsp; The various half hearted attempts to kill him might just
be
his own private way of annoying the Doctor.</span></span><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NOTE:
&nbsp;Usually this virus is too weak to harm a Time Lord
but during regeneration the Doctor was vulnerable to it.&nbsp;His
fourth or fifth subsequent regenerations will
turn him into a member of the Faction Paradox and he will lose his
shadow.&nbsp; The virus will rewrite and change the Doctor's past and
future.&nbsp; Eventually the Doctor's origin will changed so that he
began life as a crystaline skeleton being named Soul who serves on the
Council of Eight.&nbsp; After the rest of the Council is destroyed he
paradoxically absorbs a new form and information from the 8th
Doctor.&nbsp; Soul take Sabbath's timeship and flees with Miranda's
daughter Zezanne.&nbsp; They are drawn to I.M. Foreman's Junkyard and
land there in 1963.&nbsp; They take on the names Doctor and Susan

&nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; Due to their amazingly strong empathic bond the Doctor's
TARDIS realizes that he has been infected with the Paradox Virus.&nbsp;
It takes the Doctor's infected "shadow" into itself by acting as a
Paradox Machine. &nbsp;The timeline is held in temporal orbit.&nbsp;
This kept the Doctor's new body (and
subsequent bodies) from being tainted by the Paradox and ensures that
his future remained unchanged.&nbsp; The energy required to contain the
diseased timeline is massive and increases as time goes by. &nbsp;In
the new timeline Planet of the Spiders doesn't occur but the rest of
history unfolds in more or less the
same way.</span>

As the Faction Virus slowly infects the TARDIS the potential of the
contained timeline leads to a build up of temporal energy.&nbsp; This
buildup causes the timelines of the Universe to become twisted and
malleable.&nbsp; Whole regions of space-time begin warping until they
are almost parallel universes.&nbsp; These regions are connected to
each other and the rest of the Universe by an enclave of time corridors
known as the Obverse.&nbsp; The Enclave is located in the Obverse, a
hidden “boil” located in the “underbelly” of the Universe.&nbsp; In the
Enclave, time and space are not connected and the physical laws are
different and variable.&nbsp; The Time Lords know little about the
races
that inhabit the Enclave.&nbsp; The Enclave will not attract the
Swimmers to the Multiverse.&nbsp; These regions begin
to spread.&nbsp; By the time of "The Ancestor Cell" it will be strong
enough to destroy half of the galaxy.</span></p>

he secretly expects the worst case senerio to occure most places he

extreamly powerful weapons&nbsp;to the Sontarans, Cybermen and the
Daleks. &nbsp;The CIA sends Straxus of the House of Kotris to purchase
weapons from the Vess to defend Gallifrey from other Temporal powers.
&nbsp;The Master discovered Straxus' mission and threatened to expose
it to the High Council. &nbsp;To prevent this, Straxus let the Master
purchase a single weapon from the Vess that he would use on the Doctor.
&nbsp;The Master uses the newly acquired Conceptual Bomb on the Doctor.
&nbsp;<span class="A-alternate">The bomb seized upon
the conception that Bob Dovie had when he first entered the TARDIS - that
this was impossible - and made that thought reality. &nbsp;With the
TARDIS erased from history, she never would have stolen the Doctor and
left Gallifrey. &nbsp;This caused Time to fold in on the Doctor as it
erases him from history. &nbsp;Everything the Doctor ever did ever did
was undone. &nbsp;The Dalek invasion of the Earth </span></span></span><span class="A-alternate">in the 22nd century </span><span class="A-tv"><span class="A-audiobook"><span class="A-alternate">was never repelled, and Magnus' (The War Cheif's) armies conqured most of the Galaxy.</span> </span></span><span class="A-tv"><span class="A-audiobook">&nbsp;The
folding of time alowed all of the Doctor's first 8 incarnations have to
interact with each other and they were able to change history so that
Dovie did believe in the existance of the TARDIS. &nbsp;This prevented
the Doctor from ever being erased from history and most of everyone's
memories of these events were lost. &nbsp;<span class="A-fanon">It
should be noted that the jonbar hinge of the Masters intervension is
basically the same as the one depicted in Auld Mortality. &nbsp;</span></span></span></p>

&nbsp;The station has multiple real world infaces imbeded inside its

cells) aren't actualy inside the TARDIS's micro-universe but are merely
part of the exo-shell. &nbsp;All of the walls and doors of these

&nbsp;Locations found inside the TARDIS include the living quarters,
engins, and courtrooms. &nbsp;</span>The Oubliette of Eternity Dispersal
Chamber is found
there.&nbsp; Those placed in the chamber would have their time line
erased creating a new timeline where they would never have existed.
&nbsp;Officially this practice had been discontinued, but the CIA continued to use it for dispersal of Gallifreyan
troublemakers. &nbsp;In addition to the already existing Oubliette, <span class="A-tv">the <span class="A-game">Justice</span> Station would have <span class="A-game">multiple</span> courtooms, several Matrix links (in each court room<span class="A-game"> and counsel quarters), </span></span><span class="A-game"><span class="A-game">a

&nbsp;A Hostile Action Displacement System is installed and the scanner
is upgraded to be better at tracking Timeships and other temporal
anomalies. &nbsp;It is specifically programed with the signatures of
several TT Capsules known to be in renegade hands. &nbsp;The time scoop
was designed to collect the capsules from the Vortex and deliver them
to a point near the station where a tractor beam would bring them in to
one of 6 ports. &nbsp;The stations sapient matrix is given governer
circuits that make it obsessed with the Laws of Time and is

Gallifey's Police Academy. &nbsp;Because of the number of people
serving on it, rumors about the station were rampent on Gallifrey.

He Jest's At Scars...(part 1): In an alternate universe the Doctor
went back into the Matrix to try to save the Valeyard.&nbsp; They become
trapped inside fighting eachother.&nbsp; The Matrix predicts that
battling Doctors might fight for centuries.&nbsp; But eventually the
Valeyard defeates the Doctor (because of the contract the Doctor signed
and the promises made to him by Niroc) and the two Doctors merge into
one
composite Doctor who has all the experience of all 12 Doctors.&nbsp;
His Chronic Energy (Reality
Quotient) and Artron energy is so amazing that he became
immortal.&nbsp; A
timelord with large amounts of
chronic energy is capable of using a TARDIS to change his own history
and other hyper crystallized events on a whim.&nbsp; The authoriztion
from the previous
High Council allows the Valeyard to escape the Matrix.&nbsp; Once he
escapes the Valeyard begins collecting tools that will let him access or
wield great power.&nbsp; The Valeyard uses the Doomesday Weapon on
Exerius to destory Gallifey.&nbsp; This eradicated the Time Lord's past
and future.&nbsp; The Valeyard deleates his own past by murdering his
past self.&nbsp; He uses his TARDIS's Eye of Harmony to create a new
Anchor Point for the Web of Time at the center of the
Vortex.&nbsp;&nbsp; Being the last Time Lord he has complete access to
the Power of
Creation.&nbsp; He can travel
through time and space just by thinking about it and create alternated
universe as he
pleases.&nbsp; His every movement alters history whether he wants it to
or not.&nbsp; </span><br class="A-alternate">

decides to place secret operatives who will be able to influence
species who are attempting to become (already are) Time Active. The
first attempt to created these agents involved Daleks but it failed
rather spectacularly. For the second attempt the Klyst Institute was
set up on CIA Station 7. &nbsp; Professor Klyst and others attempt to
place newly birthed TARDIS sentiences into the the minds of aliens.
The aliens were promised several lifetimes of success in return for
donating their bodies the day before they were due to die. Subjects
were acquired from almost 50 planets, but this time none of them were
Daleks. The Time Lady Professor Klyst oversaw the implantation of the
TARDIS sentients but in most cases the resulting being was insane.
This was due to incompatibilities between the neural configuration.

Sentient which almost destroys his mind. After having the sentient
removed the Doctor helped two sentients to achieve a stable union

why that version of himself kept ending up alone. &nbsp;</span><span class="A-game">Believing that he has averted the Time War</span><span class="A-audiobook"><span class="A-game">, </span>the Doctor now feels
that he can start over with a new life and enjoy his work &nbsp;He

makes a point of not travelling alone so that he won't forget the value
of the individual. &nbsp;He's not very good at hand-to-hand combat.
&nbsp;The reign
of&nbsp;</span><span class="A-audiobook">Edward the Confessor is one of his favorite points in history. &nbsp;</span><span class="A-tv"><span class="A-audiobook">He will often visit the Tantalus Eye because of its breathaking beauty. &nbsp;</span></span><span class="A-audiobook">He loves dinosaurs, spiders and cats. </span><span class="A-audiobook">&nbsp;<span class="A-tv">He likes jellybabies</span>
(particularly red ones). &nbsp;Sometimes he likes his tea with 6
sugars, other times with no sugar. &nbsp;He rarely remembers his
dreams. </span><span class="A-audiobook">The Doctor believes that the forces of Time are impersonal and unthinking, but he prays daily to his gods. </span><span class="A-audiobook">&nbsp;<span class="A-tv">He is not fond of heigths, </span>or eating meat, but will put up with fast food cheeseburgers. &nbsp;He hates people who write in books. &nbsp;<span class="A-fanon">It is possible that that the half-human part of his biology is the the
reason that this incarnation of the Doctor keeps losing his
memory.&nbsp; Maybe it can’t hold all the experience of a Gallifreyan

</span><br><span class="A-notbbc">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By presidential decree the
cloneworld colonies are kept completely out of contact with each
other and with the original Gallifrey Officially this was done to
ensure that Time Lord society survived the War. However the project
was shrouded in secrecy and it is rumored that the original Gallifrey
might have been shifted to a new location leaving a cloneworld as a
decoy in its place. Such a move could have had a large (but unknown)
effect on the History of the Spiral Politic. Officially each
cloneworld is occupied by caretaker-Houses but since communication
and travel between them is forbidden each one
believes itself to be the original Gallifrey and each has it's own
Lord or Lady President. &nbsp;</span><span class="A-fanon"><span class="A-audiobook">Each of the Clone Worlds think the other Gallifreys are merely Dominions of their Gallifrey. </span></span><span class="A-fanon"><br>&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; As
part of the defense mechanisms these other Gallifreys appear not be
connected with the Protocols of Linearity (aka the 3rd Law of Time).
&nbsp;Indeed it is possible that a new Law of Time was passed to
prevent each Gallifrey's causal nexus from interacting directly with
the others. &nbsp;This would mean that any enemy who engadged one of
the cloneworlds who then be trapped by the Protocols of Linearity
making it very difficult for them to mount an attack on any other
Gallifrey (or their agents). &nbsp;Any Time Lord who survived their
Gallifrey's destruction would only be able to visit worlds which either
had no connection with the War or worlds where it was believed that
Gallifrey had fallen. &nbsp;Effectively they would be stranded in the
Post Time War era. &nbsp;This is exactly what we see in the 8th Doctor
after The Ancestor Cell. &nbsp;Though the 8th Doctor was able to get
back into the Pre-Time War era, both after the events of Taking of

			* Hedin's death in Arc of Infinity is the only real contradiction

			("[Hedin] was an historian, a mainstay of the High Council,
			as his father had been before him" pg. 27). And the comment
			(on pg. 157) "A Hedin was still a Hedin" both support
			this idea. <br><br> *The Doctor is between 1011-1295<br><br>
			*Lance has indicated that TID does not, in his opinion, take place
			after "The Gallifrey Chronicles" but Lance has also
			stated that he intended fains fans should place the story where
			they feel it fits best - so this placement is still consistent
			with authorial intention. <br><br> *Also Larna's appearance in
			"Unnatural History" might be out of sync. She is
			probably taking a field internship as part of her academy training
			(this would be before she met the Doctor). Larna certainly doesn't
			act like she knows him. On the other hand maybe the meeting IS out
			of sync. She might be working on repairing the Effect. The Doctor
			IS very reluctant to contact Joyce and Larna. He might realize
			that they're out of sync. Maybe Larn's lack of interest is because
			she realizes he's out of sync and is trying to avoid a paradox.</span></p>

The Battle of Mutter's Cluster / The Ancestor Cell (continued): Faced
with letting Grandfather Paradox destroy all of causality and riddle
the Multiverse with endless Paradox, the Doctor decides to create his
own paradox by changing his destiny.&nbsp; He triggers his TARDIS’s
weapons systems, which is the straw that breaks the camel’s back.&nbsp;
The TARDIS's improvised Paradox Machine gives up holding in the
temporal energy of the displaced timeline and Foreman's Universe in
Bottle.&nbsp; When energy is released it erased the future version of
Faction Paradox thus preventing them from ever invading the Matrix in
the first place.&nbsp; History is altered to the point where the
Grandfather Paradox version of the Doctor can no longer exists, so he
fades away.&nbsp; The Doctor uses his link with Compassion to upload
a copy of his memories to her data banks.&nbsp; He then deletes his
memories and places a very compressed copy of the Matrix into his
mind.&nbsp; This includes the minds of 153,841 Time Lords who have
existed up until this point.&nbsp; The energy escapes the TARDIS and
destroys the entire Kasterborous Sector.</span><span class="A-licensed">&nbsp;
</span><span class="A-audiobook">The destruction of Gallifrey spreads
temporal fallout onto other planets killing almost everything on

they acquire armor and defenses designed to repel known Enemy

to reproduce.&nbsp; There are thousands (if not more) of aliens who
volunteer to serve the Time Lords.&nbsp; The aliens receive a form of
brainwashing called a Briefing.&nbsp; The Briefing convinces the

Lords were bribed into returning to Gallifrey.&nbsp; They were
captured, and lobotomized by military psychosurgeons from House
Mirraflex.&nbsp; These renegades were connected to the Babels via a
neural link to keep the Babels under control.&nbsp; <br><br>?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (After the War has been going
for a while) <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

new sub-Houses for experimentation.&nbsp; Many abandoned Houses are
reactivated to for experimentation and to increase troop numbers.&nbsp;

&nbsp; (Early War era) <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The House Military branch of
House Arpexia attempt to test the “Jungle Children” folktale by
creating Kaspar Hauser on Earth in 1828.&nbsp; Within 3 weeks he had
learned to read, count, write, and play the harpsichord.&nbsp; He
also changed the course of German history.&nbsp; After 5 years of
exposure to human culture Hauser was removed and the project was
declared a failure.&nbsp; The research did however lead to the
development of the Temporal Vaccinations.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br><br>1162?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Shortly after the “jungle child”
experiment) <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Entarodora develops her
“Disturbance by Mystery” theory which will later be used by
Robert Scarratt.&nbsp; <br><br>1162&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (11 years after
the War begins / after the Jungle Children project / right before the
Lethean Campaign) <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Third Wave of the House
Military is created.&nbsp; </span><span class="A-audiobook">The
biological defenses that Time Lords have against the Great Vampires
and the Charon are reconnected in all Gallifreyans.&nbsp; </span><span class="A-notbbc">Troops
used by the Time Lords are re-engineered by reprocessing their
timelines instead of using nano-tech.&nbsp; When these
non-Gallifreyans are infected with the Immortality Virus they are
able to regenerate, but they will have much less control over the
process.&nbsp; They physically age only one year for ever 3 or 4 that
pass.&nbsp; Their cells will "evolve" and "improve"
themselves.&nbsp; With each regeneration the subject's appearance and
abilities will get farther and farther from the species norm.&nbsp;
The Time Lords give the agents special drugs that control how they
regenerate, turning them into whatever the Time Lords want them to
be.&nbsp;</span><span class="A-audiobook">&nbsp; </span><span class="A-notbbc">They
are re-engineered to regenerate into a more "military" form
with each regeneration. These troops quickly lose any semblance of
humanoid form.&nbsp; The first regeneration produces built in armor.
&nbsp;The 12th creates a being that is hardly even organic.&nbsp; The
intermediary officers of the House Military object to these
modifications but are overruled.&nbsp; The Third (and subsequent)
Waves use Temporal Vaccinations instead of nano-augmentation to
protect themselves from damage.&nbsp; They work by introducing
several small changes in subjects history makes his history resistant
to large-scale change.&nbsp; Soldiers who have undergone temporal
vaccinations are sometimes called Hybrids.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span class="A-fanon">1162?&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class="A-notbbc"><span class="A-licensed">(during the Time War <span class="A-fanon">/ probably not before the Third Wave / probably after the High Council funds&nbsp;</span></span></span><span class="A-fanon">Crozier's

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 73 undamaged Casts and the several Babels were

Campaign was the last crusade of the Second Wave and the first of the
Third Wave.&nbsp; The enemy’s time ship eating weapons destroys the

Forced military Regen Missions become a standard House Military
strategy.&nbsp; The Regenerated Infantry (Regen-Inf) troops sent on
these missions will be forcibly regenerated into forms that will best
suit the mission. <span class="A-licensed">Forced regenerations are much more painful then regular regenerations.&nbsp;</span> This is done by introducing mutagens into the
regenerative matrix that given them defenses, weapons, and Symbiotic
Nuclei&nbsp; These mutagens also make them sterile.&nbsp; They serve
as frontline soldiers and siege weapons.&nbsp; Since most of these
Time Front troops are recruited from lesser species they often
permanently stationed off of Gallifrey.</span></p>

&nbsp; &nbsp;A cousin from House Mirraflex spends decades impersonates a
messiah-figure on a post-human world to prepare the culture for

regeneration to “die” and be “reborn.”&nbsp; </span>

Saved would make the ultimate defensive location for the House of
Mirraflex.&nbsp; She mounts an attack on the City with over 100 Type
91 War TARDISes.&nbsp; After the complete failure of the attack (and
the destruction of 11 TARDISes) Mantissa retired from the post of
Lady Armorer and relocated to a different clone of Gallifrey.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>1169?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(Scarrett is at the rapid growth age of 20) <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Captain in Waiting Robert Scarratt is a member of the House
Military’s Fourth Wave.&nbsp; He is assigned to a Xianthellipse
monitoring post stationed near a Post-Human world, and is responsible
for delivering shipments of psychotemporal agent Praxis to the
Homeworld.&nbsp; He becomes addicted to the drug.&nbsp; With the help
of the Praxis and several Humans, he prevents a violent revolt on the
nearby world.&nbsp; <br><br>??&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some factions of the
Posthuman human hegemony devote themselves to historical
re-enactment.&nbsp; This combined with their use of the time travel
psychotemporal drug Praxis concerns the Time Lords.&nbsp; <br><br>??&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In an alternate version of history a race of nonhumans (possibly Time
Lords) was supposed to become Praxis. &nbsp;<span class="A-fanon">It possible that the Praxis represents the physical manifestation of the enemy's history intruding into the Web of Time. &nbsp;</span><br><br>1169?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Time Lords become desperate enough to
whole-heartedly embrace physical technology (often known as burlesque
devices) such as nanites, robots, D-mat guns, and other purely
mechanical tools.&nbsp; Robert Scarratt is a proponent of such
burlesque as a moral booster.&nbsp; The Time Lords begin using the
word D-Mat as slang to refer to any weapon capable of destroying a
planet.&nbsp; Forced Regen Missions usually carry at least one
symbolic D-Mat weapon.&nbsp; The Fourth Wave makes extensive use of
“D-Mat” weapons and Killerbots.&nbsp; <br><br>?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Robert Scarratt undergoes a series of rapid promotions, demotions,
and reassignments.&nbsp; He is insubordinate and bends the Laws of
Time by disappearing in his TARDIS for a year subjectively (but no
time objectively).&nbsp; The near-renegade’s counter culture
activities and habits are tolerated only because of his successful
infiltrations, assignations and confusions.&nbsp; Despite not being a
Prydonian he wears scarlet.&nbsp; He might have been created via

Us Go: Anthropological Predictions show that Humanity was on the
verge of evolving into a non-linear time-active culture capable of
processing entire universes of information called Homo Imago.&nbsp;
This is called The Younger World Theory.&nbsp; Humans and
Gallifreyans are the only races whose cultures can not be accurately
predicted by these projections.&nbsp; Humanity would have had a field
of comprehension larger then the Time Lord’s Noosphere.&nbsp;</span><span class="A-fanon">

human named Valentine is working for the one of the Higher Powers

on earth.&nbsp; The Great Houses deploy a Ghost Cluster device on him

Despite this the Timeship is still accidentally destroyed.&nbsp; An
unexpected side effect of this is that Humanity misses its first
opportunity to achieve its conversion into Homo Imago.&nbsp; Instead
of making that leap humanity slides into a state of virtual cultural

are still strictly formal at this point in the Time War.
The High Council of the Homeworld is made up of Cousins from the
Houses of Dvora, Tracolix, Lineacrux, Arpexia, Xianthellipse, and
Mirraflex. &nbsp;<span class="A-licensed">The Inner Council meets in the Black Void – an chamber in the upper levels of the Citadel, cut off from normal space and time. </span>&nbsp;<span class="A-tv">Below
the High Council is the <span class="A-licensed">Time</span> War Council (or Council of War)</span> of
the Great Houses <span class="A-audiobook">which meets in the War Room. &nbsp;The War Room is the nerve center of the entire <span class="A-notbbc">House</span> Military.&nbsp;</span> Every active House
is represented on the War Council. The Master has known some members of
the War Council for several life-times.&nbsp; House Arpexia,
Xianthellipse, and Mirraflex are all members of the House
Military.&nbsp;
Most Time Lords view the House of Mirraflex as being dangerously out
of control.&nbsp; Time Lords of these Houses will often wear
ceremonial battle forms to major official events.&nbsp;</span><span class="A-notbbc">The Time Lords prefer
to use and diplomats to gain allies to fight for them in the war.&nbsp;</span><span class="A-notbbc"> </span><span class="A-audiobook">By
this point Gallifreyan Civil Servants have a psychic tripwire that
cause death by psychic seizures if they try to reveal confidential
information. &nbsp;</span><span class="A-notbbc">Paradox Anxiety (the fear that one is
trapped in a paradox) is now a major problem among the Time Lords and </span><span class="A-notbbc">Temporal Vaccinations have become very popular. &nbsp;</span><span class="A-notbbc">All nonmilitary research missions have been suspended.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Very few members of the House Military appear to
be remotely humanoid. &nbsp;To combat pardox anxiety, and other stresses of the War, troops, agents, and
officers are given the ability to reboot their personality to an
earlier state of being.&nbsp; This is done by overlaying a previously
saved personality matrix on the mind of the psychologically disabled
individual.&nbsp; Though common among the Regen-Inf, the Time Lords
rarely use these devices, claiming to be above psychological
disturbance. &nbsp;</span><span class="A-notbbc">At
this point almost all off-world Time Lords are either classified as
Field Agents or they are assigned to Boundary Posts. <span class="A-fanon">&nbsp;Their battle cry is "Prydon, Rassilon, and Gallifrey!"</span> &nbsp;There are
more 103-Forms in use then any other
type/form of TARDIS.&nbsp; There are at least 59 time-fleets, all
numbered.&nbsp; It is not hard for a moderately sized time fleet to
extinguish even a well protected star.&nbsp; As of this point no
104-Form TARDIS has not been invented but a break through is
expected.<span class="A-game"> (By the end of they Time War they won't have reach&nbsp;the Type 110)&nbsp;</span> The Type 91 is the only other TARDIS breed still in
production. &nbsp;</span><span class="A-notbbc"><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The head of
space traffic control is now known as the Gate Keeper. &nbsp;</span><span class="A-notbbc">Some claim that each Homeworld has more defense systems then it has
inhabitants. </span><span class="A-notbbc">Even
for timeships that have permission to approach, the space-time course
through all the defenses of the Home World is very complicated.&nbsp;
Under most circumstances homeworld security must have a biodata extract
from a potential visitor before they will be allowed on Gallifrey.
&nbsp;</span><span class="A-notbbc">The Citadel of the Time Lords (which includes the War Council's chambers, the Eye of
Harmony, and its TARDIS womb) is the most well defended location in the

this point the War has spanned millions of years of real history
and has cost billions of lives.&nbsp; The War is being fought on 920
fronts and nearly 500,000 worlds. &nbsp;Most (if not all) of these
fronts have been the same for the last 50 years of the War.&nbsp; </span><span class="A-audiobook">The Time Lords have defensive arrays that are the size of entire star systems. &nbsp;</span><span class="A-notbbc">Both the Enemy and the Time Lords
appear to have an unwritten agreement to abide by most of the Laws of

active nature of the War both sides have all the pre-planning time
they require.</span><span class="A-notbbc"> &nbsp;The Enemy (and probably the Time Lords) can detect any incursion into
N-Space by time travelers at a tactically important world. &nbsp;</span><span class="A-audiobook">99% of the Time War

battles are won but tricking the opposing force into believing that
they were the winners.&nbsp;</span><span class="A-audiobook">&nbsp;</span><span class="A-notbbc">A major War tactic is checking the
future outcome of a battle after the forces have been committed but
before the war has been fought.&nbsp; Then altering the nature of the
forces to fulfill history without wasting extra personnel.&nbsp; A
more complex tactic is to plant false history records to thwart the
above tactic.</span><span class="A-audiobook">
&nbsp;A significant tool in the War are Ur-Boxes. &nbsp;They broadcast
signals into the Vortex that present a set pre-recorded events over a
localized area. &nbsp;Any time scanner that tunes into that time zone
will see history unfolding as presente in the pre-recorded files, when,
in reality, intervensionists can be undertaking a mission to alter
events. &nbsp;The range of a Ur-Box is limited to less then a mile,
which can require that the unit to physically re-enact certain nearby
events to maintain the illusion. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span class="A-notbbc">&nbsp;</span><span class="A-notbbc"><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The few lesser species that

actualizers of Faction Paradox manage to create (probably using
block-transfer mathematics) a box that holds the doorway and key to the
Peace.&nbsp; This Peace is then offered to both the Time Lords and
their enemy.&nbsp; Both sides send negotiators.&nbsp; Negotiator
Melmoufex represents the Great Houses in the negotiations and
Negotiator Suroboruo represents the enemy.&nbsp; The Symbiotes serve as
the mediators for these peace talks.&nbsp; The peace was created by
both sides bribing the Faction Paradox arbitrator to ensure the other
side loses. Thus both sides provided the Faction with vast amounts of
resources but the effect of their bribery cancelled out, resulting in
no peace for either party.&nbsp; The Peace explodes, destroying
Dysgenia, both negotiators, their timeships, and erasing the symbiotes

<p><h2>THE HISTORY OF THE TIME LORDS PART VII <br>

The Last of The Time Lords and Earth's History<br>
</h2></p>

</center>
<span class="A-fanon"><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This Time Line covers the
life of the Doctor in the New TV Series.&nbsp;
It ranges from the 9th Doctor to the end of the Universe.&nbsp;&nbsp; The numbers are based off the birth of the
Doctor.&nbsp;
They are given in Gallifreyan years (which are the same as earth
years).&nbsp; The AF Numbers in Parenthesis refer to the Doctor's age in the New TV Series, as
quoted in "Aliens of London."</span><span class="A-fanon">
&nbsp;This discrepencey is due to the 9th Doctor giving his age at the
time of his regeneration as being about 800 years old. &nbsp;Yet the
6th Doctor was 953 years old when he regenerated.&nbsp; Since people
age slower when on board
the TARDIS this new lower number might be his corrected age when
all&nbsp; "of time
and space" is taken into account.&nbsp; This might also because of his
rebirth in in a new body in the City of the
Saved.&nbsp; For the purposes of this website, I'm assuming that these
new, lower numbers, represents his age since his resurrection in the
City of the Saved. &nbsp;This conclusion that I have used for my
calculations.&nbsp; From
this point forward I will note the New Series version of the Doctor's
age
in partenthsesis with an AF, along with the Doctor's actual age.&nbsp; </span><br>

Bad Wolf / </span></span><span class="A-fanon"><span class="A-tv">The Parting of the Ways: By this point the Doctor is just wanting a quiet life. &nbsp;The Emperor
Dalek<span class="A-audiobook"> (the first Dalek
created by Davros)</span>
is discovered in Earth's
future.&nbsp; He has changed history, setting humanity's development
back about 90 years. &nbsp;He is turning the human race into
Daleks but selecting one cell out of every billion from his victums.
&nbsp;By so doing he has created a total of 400,000 Daleks who have
constructed </span></span><span class="A-fanon"><span class="A-tv">200 Daleks saucers</span></span><span class="A-fanon"><span class="A-tv">.
&nbsp;The Doctor plans to destroy all of the Daleks with delta waves of
Van Cassedyne energy, but this will also kill all life on the Earth.
&nbsp;The Doctor realizes that he doesn't have the strength to choose
the lesser of two evils, as he did when he destroyed Gallifrey, and
abandons this plan. &nbsp;He begins to wonder if its time for his life
to end. &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rose looks into the TARDIS's
Heart and is recruited by the TARDIS to save the Doctor and stop the
Daleks. &nbsp;She becomes a composite of Rose and the TARDIS, known as
the Bad Wolf, and</span></span><span class="A-fanon"><span class="A-tv"> is imbuned with godlike
powers of <span class="A-audiobook">Artron </span>Energy
the Space-Time Vortex. &nbsp;The Bad Wolf is capable of modifying and
distorting probability on a massive scale throughout history. &nbsp;She
is effectively the will of the TARDIS (or possibly the Universe)
incarnate <span class="A-fanon">and is possibly creating the plot of the Doctor's entire life. &nbsp;</span></span></span><span class="A-fanon"><span class="A-tv">While
she is the Bad Wolf she describes the Doctor as being her's. &nbsp;She
can pilot the TARDIS through the Vortex. &nbsp;She use that Power of
Creation to destroy every Dalek in the
Universe. &nbsp;She claims that she is responsible for ending the Time
War.&nbsp; She also brings Jack Harkness back to life by making
him a fixed point in time.&nbsp; He can never stay dead because the
fact of his life is anchored into history itself. &nbsp;This
makes him an obscene violation of the Laws of Time such that it takes a
significant effort of will for either the TARDIS or the Doctor to be
near him. &nbsp;Despite numerous other deaths, Jack is the only person
here that the Bad Wolf decides to resurrect.&nbsp; She seeds the idea
of the Bad Wolf across time and space to ensure her own creation.
&nbsp;She probably arranges for the weak point in space-time at Bad
Wolf Bay in Norway that allows the Doctor to say goodby to her in&nbsp;</span></span><span class="A-audiobook"><span class="A-fanon"><span class="A-tv">Doomesday. &nbsp;</span></span></span><span class="A-fanon"><span class="A-tv">It is unclear what other changes to the Universe she might have made during this time, <span class="A-fanon">but the corruption in time caused by her actions might have</span> unsealed the </span></span><span class="A-tv"> Medusa Cascade. &nbsp;It was this that allowed the New Dalek Empire to construct a Reality Bomb to destroy the Universe. &nbsp;</span><span class="A-tv"><span class="A-licensed">The

regeneration
to proceed - purging his body of the remaining excess energy. &nbsp;He
considers himself part of history and takes direct action to solve the
problems he encounters. &nbsp;He considers himself to be Earth's
champion.&nbsp; </span></span><span class="A-tv"><span class="A-fanon"><span class="A-licensed">This new incarnation is still Time's

&nbsp;This can result in a dispassionet or even enthusiastic
exterminations of those failures. &nbsp;This incarnation
still has fillings in his teeth. &nbsp;Unlike his previous incarnation,
he does enjoy interacting with familys, and building extended social
bonds. &nbsp;He begins wearing
glasses to make himself look clever and wears tennis shoes as an homage
to his 5th incarnation. &nbsp;He hates pears, being shot at, Margaret
Thatcher, and hospitals, but loves the little shops that can be found
in a hospital. &nbsp;He thinks knowing everything would be boring. &nbsp;He also loves the music of Ian Dury and the
Blockheads, The Muppet Movie, and werewolf stories &nbsp;</span><span class="A-fanon">Its possible that the Bad Wolf deliberately shaped the Doctor new body and mind to fit with Rose's wishes. &nbsp; </span></span></span></span><br>

Time Lords of Gallifrey&nbsp;find the remains of one of the cracks in
the skin of realty (from the TARDIS exploding). &nbsp;They use it to
broadcast a message throughout all of time and space.
&nbsp;Because of this, it becomes the oldest question in the
Universe.&nbsp; The
question is &#8220;Doctor Who?&#8221;&nbsp;The Time
Lords are looking for the Doctor&#8217;s original name, and they believe he
is the only one in the post Time War era who could can correctly answer
the question. &nbsp;The Time Lords also broadcast a truth
field out of the crack to ensure that any answer given to the question
will be honest and correct.&nbsp;   If
the
Doctor gives his correct name then the Time Lords will know they have
found the right place and that it is safe to emerge. &nbsp;Numerous
voices of Gallifreyans can be heard eminating from the crack. &nbsp;The
most frequent and clear of these voices is the General of the War
Council. &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The

technology to detect it. &nbsp;Half

signal. &nbsp;They realize that if the Time Lords return it will start
another Time War, and they form an alliance to prevent this. &nbsp;The
last time Gallifrey rose out
of the Time War, the Time Lords tried to destroy the Universe.&nbsp;

&nbsp;But
in a peice written by Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Magazine has revealed
that (despite the events of Time of the Doctor) at some point in the
Doctor's distant future the dying TARDIS will end up on on Trenzalore
and the
Doctor's biodata threads will be exposed to normal space&nbsp;</span></span></span><span class="A-licensed">via a

She ends up hiding under the Doctor&#8217;s bed and grabbing his leg when he
wakes up.&nbsp; This scares him badly, but Clara tell him that this is
just a dream and calms him down.&nbsp; She tells him that fear can make
him smarter, faster, and more kind.&nbsp; She also tells him that it
okay to be afraid of things that don&#8217;t exist, and that fear makes
companions of everyone and that fear will bring him home.&nbsp; She
leaves him with a toy soldier who has no gun.<br><br></span></span></span></span></span></span><span class="A-fanon">3063?&nbsp;

He Jest's At Scars...(part 1): In an alternate universe the Doctor
went back into the Matrix to try to save the Valeyard.&nbsp; They
become
trapped inside fighting eachother.&nbsp; The Matrix predicts that
battling Doctors might fight for centuries.&nbsp; But eventually the
Valeyard defeates the Doctor (because of the contract the Doctor signed
and the promises made to him by Niroc) and the two Doctors merge into
one
composite Doctor who has all the experience of all 12 Doctors.&nbsp;
His Chronic Energy (Reality
Quotient) and Artron energy is so amazing that he became
immortal.&nbsp; A
timelord with large amounts of
chronic energy is capable of using a TARDIS to change his own history
and other hyper crystallized events on a whim.&nbsp; The authoriztion
from the previous
High Council allows the Valeyard to escape the Matrix.&nbsp; Once he
escapes the Valeyard begins collecting tools that will let him access
or
wield great power.&nbsp; The Valeyard hopes to someday destroy all of
the Time Lords, the Daleks, and the Cybermen, and then harness the
power of humanity. The Valeyard uses the Doomesday Weapon on
Exerius to destory Gallifey.&nbsp; This eradicated the Time Lord's past
and future.&nbsp; The Valeyard deleates his own past by murdering his
past self.&nbsp; He uses his TARDIS's Eye of Harmony to create a new
Anchor Point for the Web of Time at the center of the
Vortex.&nbsp;&nbsp; Being the last Time Lord he has complete access to
the Power of
Creation.&nbsp; He can travel
through time and space just by thinking about it and create alternated
universe as he
pleases.&nbsp; His every movement alters history whether he wants it to
or not.&nbsp; </span><br class="A-alternate">

<br>
While I hesitate to call Craig a close friend (we hadn&#8217;t done more then
debate continuity for over a year) I was very sad to learn of his
death.&nbsp; For me Craig was&#8230;<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *An Idol: He routinely did what I
only dreamed of &#8211; wrote Doctor Who novels.&nbsp; And he was friends
with people like Andy Lane, Justin Richards, and Gary Russell and if
that isn&#8217;t sitting among the gods&#8230;.. <br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *A Friend: He cheered me up when
I was down and vice versa.&nbsp; He mention my wife and me in the text
and the acknowledgments of &#8220;Synthespians[TM].&#8221;&nbsp; And for a few mad
weeks we were both planning on attending each others weddings!<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *A Mentor: He proof read my early
drafts of the <a href="https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B6zjenFzzQn1MF9xeHNNS1M1akU/edit?pli=1"><span style="font-weight: bold;">TARDIS Technical Index</span></a><span style="font-weight: bold;"> </span>and told me that it should be
something better and nicer then just another page on my rather sloppy
website.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *An Advocate: He had several
conversations with Justin Richards of BBC Books about getting the
TARDIS Technical Index published.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * A Writing Partner: I test read
and offered suggestions for &#8220;Excelis Decays.&#8221;&nbsp; The fact that he
took many of these suggestions to heart gave me some small chance to
affect the creation of licensed Dr. Who direction &#8211; something which
will always be a high point in my life. <br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><big><big>

is the only world capable of supporting life in the Skarosian
System.&nbsp;</span><span class="A-licensed"> It is a
little over 20,000 miles in diameter, and has a core of solid
ice.&nbsp; Because of this the planet occasionaly suffers from
icanoes.&nbsp;<span class="A-alternate"> At the heart of
this ice is a path to a pocket dimension like the one from which the
Quatch originated from.&nbsp;</span> The planet is rich with
diamonds.&nbsp; </span>The word
Skaro means "home" in old
Kaled.&nbsp;</span> In the Halldon records Skaro was known as
Ameron.&nbsp; The planet has one large
continent named Dalazar that covers just over 1/3 of its surface.&nbsp;
The rest is taken up by the Ocean of Death.&nbsp; Before the "Thousand
Year" War most of Skaro had a temperate climate.&nbsp; Now most of the
continent of Dalazar is desert.&nbsp; These deserts receive rain only
once every 10 years (know as the Decarain) which lasts for 7 months.<span class="A-tv"></span></span></span><span class="A-fanon"><span class="A-licensed"><span class="A-tv">&nbsp; In the more habitable
areas of
Skaro it rains once every <span class="A-licensed">4-</span>5
years.&nbsp;&nbsp; Most of Skaro's surface
is still quite radioactive, and anti-radiation drugs are nessecary for
humans to survive there for more then a few days.&nbsp; </span></span></span><span class="A-fanon"><span class="A-licensed">The Desert of

the east side of the Drammankin Mountain Range<span class="A-audiobook"> </span></span><span class="A-audiobook">is the area known as Vekis Nar-Kangji

the Capital of the Dalek Empire.&nbsp; The city is bordered by the
luminescent Lake of Mutations and the Petrified Jungle.&nbsp; <span class="A-licensed">To the north of City is a secret

SPECULATION: For being some of the most intelligent and clever speices
in the Universe Dalek conversation seems remarkably simplistic and
often
redundent.&nbsp; I postulate that when communicating with each other
Dalek
verbel statments might be akin to simple subject headings or summaries
of detailed packets of information that are being relayed via
radio.&nbsp;
Thus when a Dalek shouts "Exterminate!" it might be doing so to alert
all Daleks in the area that a new Extermination File has been sent with
detailed flow charts of tactics and target priorites along with
recomended firepower settings.&nbsp; The return crys of "Exerminate!"
might
be reply Extermination Files with aknowlegements and other progress
updates.&nbsp;&nbsp; This basic concept could be expanded to other
Dalek
statments.&nbsp; When you think about most Dalek speech sounds more
like
basic motivational statments and one scentence summaries of what could
be very complex activities or orders.&nbsp; As for when the Daleks talk
to
non-Daleks, given their arrogence who can blame them for talking to us
in baby talk - they probably don't think humans could grasp the full
complexity of Dalek communication.&nbsp; </span></span><br>

using high power EM countermeasure pods which broadcast massive

adapt to this attack by generating sensor wave pattern with their power

ROBOTIZATION AND DUPLICATION:</b><br>
<span class="A-audiobook"><span class="A-tv">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Highly
intelligent humanoid captives of the Daleks are often Robotized to
serve as loyal and trustworthy slaves of the Daleks.&nbsp; After the
cerebral
functions have been desensitized the humanoid will have a positronic
amplification disk grafted to their skull.&nbsp; A helmet with
communications equipment is then attached to the disk. While loyal
Robomen are both mentaly and physically quite slow.&nbsp; Most robomen
would go mad after a few months (a few years at most) and commited
sucicide.</span></span><span class="A-audiobook"><span class="A-tv"><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For many centuries whenever the
Daleks needed a human spy (and one could not be found through blackmail
or bribery) the Daleks would create </span></span><span class="A-audiobook"><span class="A-tv">robotic
duplicates
of humanoids using a Cell Renovator Chamber.&nbsp; <span class="A-audiobook">These duplicates had organic skin
that
carries the the correct DNA patter of the person they are
impersonating.&nbsp; Assuming that the victum was still alive, a Brain
Analysis Disk could be used to link the to the victums brainwave
patterns to the duplicate's
to allow the duplicate to access the memories of the victum. <br>
<span class="A-licensed">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This technology was largely replaced by a
breakthrough in the Robotization process.&nbsp;</span> Daleks began
creating clone </span></span></span><span class="A-audiobook"><span class="A-tv">duplicates
of humanoids using genetic engineering.&nbsp; <span class="A-fanon">Once a gentic scan was availible,</span>
these clones could be generated in under hour.&nbsp; <span class="A-licensed">These clones have a new, smaller,
Postitronic Amplification Disk implanted into their brains.&nbsp; These
disks insure</span> that Dalek protocals and goals are constantly part
of the subjects thought processes - however their is no reduction int
he mental capabilities of the clone.&nbsp; <span class="A-licensed">The new disks are quite hard to
detect.</span>&nbsp; A<span class="A-audiobook"> Brain
Analysis </span>Disk can be used on the orginal humanoid to create a
record of the subjects's experiances and memories.&nbsp; This recording
can be imprinted on the clone's mind create an exact duplicate of the
orginial, but with complete devotion to the Dalek cause.&nbsp;&nbsp;
This process has a very high success rate, with only a few clones
rebeling and assuming the victum's original personality and
motivations.&nbsp; <span class="A-fanon">Daleks
countered occasional acts of rebellion by </span><span class="A-licensed">designing a typeof Postitronic
Amplification Disk<span class="A-audiobook"> </span></span><span class="A-audiobook">that create a constant Psychotropic
Link with either a specific Dalek or the Dalek Command Net in
general.&nbsp; An added opption that the Psychotropic Link offers is
that of allowing the Dalek to transfer his entire mind into the clone's
body.&nbsp; <span class="A-fanon">Dalek distaste
for humanoid is such that this would only be done when the survival of
the Daleks Species requires it.&nbsp; </span></span></span></span><span class="A-audiobook"><span class="A-tv"></span></span><br>

<span class="A-fanon">&nbsp;&nbsp; Greetings.&nbsp; I am know in these
parts as Marnal Gate and this is the worlds largest (and most badly
spellchecked) website on the Time Lords of Gallifrey. &nbsp; This was
my first web page
so I
tried to follow the KISS principle (Keep It Simple Stupid). This page
was created in March 1998. &nbsp;<br><big><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></big></span></p><p><span class="A-fanon"><big><span style="font-weight: bold;">
It was last updated in</span><b style="font-weight: bold;"> June, 2015.&nbsp; &nbsp;</b></big></span> </p>
<p><b><span class="A-notbbc">PURPOSE:</span></b> <br>
<span class="A-fanon">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have&nbsp; (shall we say 'an
obsessive'?&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; Yes, we shall) an obsessive interest in
the history of the history of the Doctor's people from before the time
of Rassilon&nbsp; to its apparent destruction in the Time War with the
Daleks.&nbsp; The idea behind
this web page is to trace all the little details about the Time Lord's
past that we have been given over the decades.&nbsp; I've also added a
section on the Daleks (though it doesn't cover as much material as I'd
like).&nbsp; If
you have any doubts as to the validity of the data presented, just
check
the color code chart at the top of each page.&nbsp; I've been pretty
religious about sticking to it.</span></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 87px; height: 99px;" alt="Doctor Who Logo" src="images/DWlogo.jpg">&nbsp;<img style="width: 412px; height: 99px;" alt="Rassilon Omega and that Other Guy" src="images/BannerNEW.png">&nbsp;<img style="width: 87px; height: 99px;" alt="Doctor Who Logo" src="images/DWlogo.jpg"></p>
