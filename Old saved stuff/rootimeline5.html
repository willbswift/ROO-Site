			<h2>THE HISTORY OF THE TIME LORDS PART V: CLASSICIAL GALLIFREY
				<br>The Doctor's Renegade Years</h2>
			<div class="section">
				<p>
					<span class="A-fanon">This Time Line covers the life of the Doctor from the Classic TV series and the New Adventure novels. It ranges from
						when he stole the TARDIS the to end of his 7th incarnation. It is set 2,000,000 years after Rassilon assumes power
						on Gallifrey (based off the Infinity Doctors and Taking of Planet Five). All dates are given in Gallifreyan years (which
						are the same as Earth years) and are based off the age of the Doctor. </span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span class="A-fanon">Once the Eye of Harmony is anchored, time began moving at a different speed on Gallifrey then the rest of the Universe.
						The Doctor was born around March 30th, 1213 AD and when Greyjan had served one year as President of Gallifrey (and
						the Doctor was 753), the Earth date was 1752 AD. It should also be noted that this differential isn't constant, but
						is slowing by about 1 second every hour (so about 1 year for ever 3,600 years). </span>
