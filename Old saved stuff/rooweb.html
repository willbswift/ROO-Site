			<h2>EYE OF HARMONY
				<br> Rassilon's Star, the Caldera, the Time-Sun, the Black Hole of Rassilon</h2>
			<div class="section">
				<span class="A-tv">Rassilon&#8217;s Star was originally a rotating
					<span class="A-infinity">Population III </span>star
					<span class="A-infinity">named Qqaba. </span>Rassilon and Omega used the Hand of Omega to turn
					<span class="A-audiobook">this</span> star into the Universe's first Black Hole.
					<span class="A-infinity">
						<span class="A-audiobook">Using Amaranths,
							<span class="A-game">trans-dimensional physics, </span>
						</span>
						<span class="A-infinity">and Stasis-Halos,</span>
					</span> Rassilon brought the nucleus of the
					<span class="A-audiobook">universe's first</span> Black Hole to Gallifrey. </span>
				<span class="A-tv">The Eye was stabilized in an eternally dynamic equation against the mass of the planet Gallifrey.
					<span class="A-audiobook">It would likely take the modern Time Lords over a century to rediscover the secrets of Rassilon and rebuild the Eye
						of Harmony. </span>
				</span>
				<span class="A-alternate">This masterpiece of spatial engineering </span>
				<span class="A-notbbc">became known as the Eye of Harmony because it sits outside History and watches the rest of the Universe. </span>
				<span
				 class="A-audiobook">
					<span class="A-fanon">
						<span class="A-notbbc">The Eye makes up the largest structure on Gallifrey
							<span class="A-audiobook">- so large that it needs its own
								<span class="A-game">fold in space</span> micro-universe
								<span class="A-notbbc">
									<span class="A-audiobook">to contain it. </span>This chamber is known as the Caldera and </span>
							</span>
						</span>
					</span>
				</span>
				<span class="A-tv">is located under the Panopticon(assembly hall) in the Capitol. </span>
				<span class="A-audiobook">The name Panopticon is derived from the Eye's ability to observer and 'see' all of space and time. </span>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<span class="A-tv">Rassilon also created the ebonite rod known as the Rod of Rassilon (sometimes </span>
				<span class="A-fanon">translated as </span>
				<span class="A-tv">"Great Key") which allows a Time Lord access to the Eye's</span>
				<span class="A-licensed">power mast. </span>
				<span class="A-alternate">The rod is also isomorphic, and can only be used those who have descended from the Looms programmed by Rassilon.
					<span

						<span class="A-game">but even short term exposure can be damaging if one is not wearing the Sash of Rassilon. </span>
					</span>
				</span>
				<span class="A-audiobook">The Caldera itself can be reached via the Vaults found beneath the Capitol. The Security Codes needed to enter the Caldera
					change every micro-span. If a lesser species was to enter the Caldera they would be killed.
					<span class="A-notbbc">Indeed, due to density of strands in the Web of Time </span>
					<span class="A-licensed">it is unhealthy for even a Time Lord to stand too close to the Eye </span>
					<span class="A-tv">unless they wear the Sash of Rassilon. </span>

							cease to exist here and anyone with a high enough
							<span class="A-fanon">reality quotient and</span> willpower can have god-like powers. </span> Outside the Event-Horizon of the spinning
						star is an area called the Ergosphere. In this area energy that escapes the singularity&#8217;s gravity is accelerated
						and amplified to almost infinite levels. Rassilon surrounded the Ergosphere with an iron sphere 10 kilometers in diameter.
						</span>
				</span>
				<span class="A-audiobook">Iron was used because a ridged material is necessary to prevent waves of gravitational energy from causing malfunctions
					in nearby systems. </span>
				<span class="A-tv">
					<span class="A-audiobook">This sphere was mirrored on the inside. Rassilon allowed a light beam to enter the sphere. This light was amplified
						by the singularity&#8217;s Ergosphere, reflected off the mirrored sphere, was amplified again, and so on. Each time
						the light beam gained energy. A small hole at the top of the sphere releases the amplified light beam. Using
						<span

						<span class="A-game">Using trans-dimensional physics
							<span class="A-audiobook">Rassilon surrounded the Eye with a transduction barrier. This </span>
						</span>shifted the Eye slightly into the future
						<span class="A-game">turning it inside out through the 5th dimension. </span>

				</span>
				<span class="A-audiobook">A fragment of the Eye of Harmony is used as the seed to create a copy of the Eye in every TARDIS. The Eye of Harmony

					<span class="A-tv">

								<span class="A-licensed">The Great Key of Rassilon is so powerful that

							</span>
						</span>
					</span>
				</span>
				<span class="A-audiobook">with an unknowable intelligence. This intelligence can read people&#8217;s intentions and actions like a book and can
					choose protectors. </span>
				<span class="A-tv">For most of the Rassilon Era the Great Key is kept hidden from the Lord President. The Key appears to have the ability
					to wipe the memories of its users (as per the wisdom of Rassilon) </span>
				<span class="A-fanon">and it is likely that when a Time Lord ceases to be Chancellor all memory of the Great Key is taken from them. </span>
				<span
				 class="A-tv">Officially the Great Key is lost and most Time Lords believe that is is only a legend. </span>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<span class="A-tv">
					<span class="A-game">Using the full energy of the Eye of Harmony, </span>the Key can power a </span>
				<span class="A-tv">planetary defense time weapon known as the </span>
				<span class="A-tv">D-Mat Gun (aka the D-mat Gun).
					<span class="A-notbbc"> The D-Mat gun is the ultimate Omnicalculator and </span>
				</span>
				<span class="A-game">was forbidden from the moment it was created.</span>
				<span class="A-notbbc"> The Great Key links this quantum computer to the Eye of Harmony </span>
				<span class="A-game">and uses a beam of zed neutrinos to carry the temporal inversion wave to the target.</span>
				<span class="A-notbbc">
					<span class="A-game"> When a target is &#8220;hit&#8221; by a D-Mat gun</span> its entire time-stream (and biodata if sentient) is recorded
					and then
					<span class="A-game">all of history is rewritten so that the only difference between this Universe, and the previous one is the total absence
						of the target. </span>Objects hit with the D-Mat gun become never-objects existing only in the gun&#8217;s perfect
					memory. </span>
				<span class="A-game">Effectively, the D-Mat Gun deletes things from history and makes that deletion a fixed point with an Relative Temporal
					Distortion of over 2. The historical shock-waves of removing a key person from history can have massive effects on the
					web of time. </span>
				<span class="A-game">Obviously, using the D-Mat Gun violates the First Law of Time. </span>
				<span class="A-audiobook">This gun can destroy an entire galaxy </span>
				<span class="A-licensed">and thus is sometimes </span>
				<span class="A-tv">known as a Galaxy Eater.</span>
				<span class="A-notbbc">During the Time War, the term 'D-mat' will be attached to numerous lesser pieces of temporal weaponry
					<span class="A-fanon">- to the point where </span>
					<span class="A-licensed">the Time Lords began referring to the original Great Key weapon as the Moment</span>
					<span class="A-fanon"> to distinguish it from</span> the lesser propagandistic weapons. </span>
				<span class="A-licensed">Through the power of the Great Key, </span>
				<span class="A-tv">the Moment can </span>
				<span class="A-game"> time lock entire sectors, </span>
				<span class="A-tv">create time fissures into and out of time locks
					<span class="A-licensed">and different parallel universes, </span>and break several other of the Laws of Time. </span>
				<span class="A-game">Depending on the size of the target, firing the weapon can create a temporal shock-wave with a radius of up to 600 meters.
					If the user deletes something from history that was key to justifying why the D-Mat gun was constructed in the first
					place they user will be knocked out for 1-6 hours and the gun will be removed from history as well. But the Great Key
					will remain. The user will likely suffer a fair amount of memory loss over the entire incident. </span>
				<span class="A-fanon">Through the Great Key, </span>
				<span class="A-tv">the Moment became so powerful that the operating system became sentient and it developed a conscience and an intelligence.
					This interface has trouble telling the difference between the past and future. </span>
				<span class="A-fanon">Through the Great Key, </span>
				<span class="A-audiobook">it can even influence their protector's subconscious actions, </span>
				<span class="A-tv"> coordinating the events of their whole life to achieve its desired ends. </span>
				<span class="A-game"> Officially, </span>
				<span class="A-tv">use of the D-Mat gun is forbidden from the moment of its creation, and instructions for its construction are one of the
					most well hidden files within the Matrix. Some Time Lords considered the Moment to be the most dangerous weapon in the

			<h2>THE SPACE-TIME VORTEX - the Astral Vortex, the Fifth Dimension</h2>
			<div class="section">
				<span class="A-game">
					<span class="A-tv"> The Space-Time Vortex (also known as the Fifth Dimension)</span>
					<span class="A-audiobook"> is the foundation for the first four dimensions.The Space-Time Vortex was brought into being</span> using a loophole
					of temporal physics.
					<span class="A-licensed">To accomplish this, Rassilon had to find and assemble the Key to Time to create the Vortex,</span> for only the Key
					to Time has the abilities equivalent to the Eye that Rassilon wished to construct.
					<span class="A-audiobook"> Working with the wisest of the Techno-Magi, </span>
					<span class="A-tv">Rassilon discovered the secret of temporal fission and set the Eye of Harmony an eternal dynamic equation balanced against
						the mass of Gallifrey. </span>
					<span class="A-audiobook">With the creation the Eye of Harmony Rassilon and the Other formatted the Astral Vortex (the 5th Dimension) </span>at
					the moment of Event 1, creating the Space-Time Vortex. This act was an essential event, as
					<span class="A-audiobook">earlier Gallifreyan researchers, and other higher evolutionaries had been accessing the Astral Vortex since the beginning
						of time. </span>The fact that the Time Lords had already been using the Vortex before they created it was seen as proof
					that Time Lord culture is the literal center of the Universe. The construction of the Vortex is a feat worthy of a Level
					11 Society, but Rassilon will keep much of this technology to himself. The rest of the Time Lords will remain a Level
					10 society.</span>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<span class="A-audiobook"> Unlike the first four dimensions, the fifth dimension is collapsed and folded into a time spiral the size of an atom.
					Since the Fifth Dimension touches the first four dimensions of Normal Space,
					<span class="A-tv">the Vortex encompasses all universes. </span>All matter, energy, and even darkness are blended into one ever shifting
					time spiral.
					<span class="A-game">The Vortex became a dimension of pure thought with a complexity that borders on sentience </span>
					<span class="A-notbbc">(in fact the Faction Paradox believe that it is sentient and refer to it the Loa). </span>The axis of the Vortex is
					a vast trans-dimensional Time Spiral that encompasses the universe and serves as a foundation for all points in space
					and time.
					<span class="A-game">The tightest coils are in the future, and the widest loops are the past. </span>
				</span>
				<span class="A-audiobook">The Eye serves as an anchor for the continuity
					<span class="A-notbbc">and causality </span>of the Universe and probably sits at the exact center of the Vortex. This nexus can be accessed
					with the Spiral Chamber. </span>
				<span class="A-tv">When plotted out in three dimensions the Vortex is usually depicted as a glittering blue void
					<span class="A-audiobook">with gold highlights. </span> But it can look like any of the opening sequences of Doctor Who. There is no air pressure
					within the Vortex
					<span class="A-audiobook"> and the time winds </span>
				</span>
				<span class="A-audiobook">are such that they would destroy any normal matter by aging it until complete structural breakdown occurred.
					<span class="A-tv">While most humanoids would die in seconds if immersed in the Vortex some Time Lords can survive in the Vortex by using
						a technique called Vortex-Walking. </span>
				</span>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<span class="A-fanon">
					<span class="A-audiobook"> The creation of the Vortex made it possible for the Time Lords (and any other species) to travel in time and space by
						moving out of Minkowski Space and integrating into the Fifth Dimension. </span>
				</span>
				<span class="A-audiobook">The Vortex is filled with a
					<span class="A-game">background radiation of</span> artron energy
					<span class="A-fanon">generated by the every sapient who has helped crystallize the Web of Time with their observations and collapsing of
						quantum probabilities.
						<span class="A-tv">Using the Vortex to journey through space and time leaves the traveler lightly irradiated with artron energy. </span>
					</span>
				</span>
				<span class="A-audiobook">
					<span class="A-tv">But Vortex travel isn't entirely safe. </span>There are freak surges
					<span class="A-game">and discharges </span>of time spillage called time spikes
					<span class="A-game">that come from and go nowhere. </span>Other dangers include quantum mirages, substrate diversions in the Vortex, and
					crossing the Time Spiral boundary. It is also possible (but very rare) for a TARDIS to become trapped in a fractional
					dimension between the Vortex and N-Space. If a TARDIS was to be trapped between a Vortex Rupture and a Subspace Infarction
					it would break up.
					<span class="A-tv">There are also uncharted areas of the Space/Time Vortex. The Mandragora Helix inhabits one such area. The Mandragora
						Helix is a spiral of pure energy radiating outwards in ways the Time Lords don't fully understand. This energy is sentient
						and has a relationship to the position of the stars. </span>
				</span>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<span class="A-tv">But the Vortex is not just a danger to a TARDIS. A TARDIS is also a danger to the Vortex. </span>
				<span class="A-audiobook">A mortally wounded TARDIS could rip a hole in the vortex as it traveled and the destruction of a fleet of 1700 timeships
					could rupture the Web of Time permanently. </span>
