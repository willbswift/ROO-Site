transmating troops down. These troops are constantly fed information

assaults the Citadel to destroy the Faction Invaders.&nbsp; Grandfather
Paradox kills Father Kreiner and tries to kill the Doctor.&nbsp; The

		<p>
			<span class="A-fanon">This is the version of history the Doctor created by undoing the Paradox version of The Ancestor Cell. Unfortunately the
				only option for undoing the Faction Paradox's invasion was to release the continuity of the Foreman Universe in a Bottle
				into the Classic Timeline, which destroys the original Gallifrey. For more information on this Bottle Universe see </span>
			<a href="rootimeline6.html#bottle">The Bottle Universe</a>
		</p>
		<p>
			<span class="A-licensed">A side effect of the Last Time War makes it very difficult to research what events the Doctor actually experienced. </span>
			<span class="A-notbbc">According to Dead Romance, all the Virgin New Adventures novels (and possibly the Missing Adventures Novels) occur inside
				I.M. Foreman's Universe in a Bottle. </span>
			<span class="A-audiobook">At the beginning of the Time War, this Bottle is emptied into the Vortex in the BBC novel The Ancestor Cell. It contaminates
				the continuity of all the stories in the Classic Universe. This contamination creates the Post Ancestor Cell Timeline
				(PACT) -</span>
			<span class="A-fanon">
				<span class="A-game">a hybrid timeline with events from both the Classic Timeline (or Time Classic, as the Doctor referes to it) and the Foreman
					Timeline integrated together.&nbsp;</span>
				<br>
				<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This integration isn't entirely smooth and some events from both timelines have
				been affected.
				<span class="A-audiobook">Some events (Human Nature) appear to have been significantly changed.</span>
				<span class="A-tv">Others (including scenes from Mind of Evil and several scenes from The Five Doctors) appear to have just been tweaked.
					</span>
				<span class="A-audiobook">This could also explain how Borusa was resurrected on two separate occasions. &nbsp;
					<span class="A-fanon">Perhaps he was resurrected </span>
				</span>
				<span class="A-fanon">once in the Foreman Timeline and then the nature of the resurrection changed once exposed to the Classic time line. So
					that now, in the PACT his resurrection occurs in&nbsp;The Eight Doctors. &nbsp;The secondary origin of the Cybermen
					presented in the new series might also be a side effect of this phenomenon as well.&nbsp;
				</span>
			</span>
		</p>
		<p>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			<span class="A-fanon">The Broadcast episodes of classic Dr Who appear to the stories least affected by this merger. Perhaps these events existed
				in BOTH Foreman’s bottle universe AND Classic Time Line, and now are be much more crystallized (aka time locked) and
				inflexible then the rest of the 'expanded universe' material. &nbsp;It would also appear that the Big Finish Continuity
				might be superior to the novel continuity since it has been referenced more often and more directly in the series. This
				could indicate that the 8th Doctor audios are more firmly crystallized in the current timeline then the 8th Doctor novels.</span>

			<br>
			<span class="A-fanon">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But in the end, any story (regardless of presentation medium), that isn't from the
				2005 TV series, now appears to be a bit uncertain. &nbsp;However School Reunion, Human Nature, and Night of the Doctor
				strongly indicate that a majority of these stories </span>
			<span class="A-fanon">(again regardless of presentation medium) </span>
			<span class="A-fanon">survive in some form. The timelines on my site are show my best guess as to what the Post Ancestor Cell Timeline now looks

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The House Military branch of House Arpexia attempt
to test the “Jungle Children” folktale by creating Kaspar Hauser on
Earth in 1828.&nbsp; Within 3 weeks he had learned to read, count,
write, and play the harpsichord.&nbsp; He also changed the course of
German history.&nbsp; After 5 years of exposure to human culture Hauser
was removed and the project was declared a failure.&nbsp; The research
did however lead to the development of the Temporal
Vaccinations.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>

The House of Xianthellipse begins actively crossbreeding troops with

capable of breeding with lesser species. &nbsp;&nbsp; Despite the

is very critical of Newblood House who pollute their biodata with

				&nbsp;
				<span class="A-licensed">The Inner Council meets in the Black Void – an chamber in the upper levels of the Citadel, cut off from normal space
					and time. </span>&nbsp;
				<span class="A-tv">Below the High Council is the
					<span class="A-licensed">Time</span> War Council (or Council of War)</span> of the Great Houses
				<span class="A-audiobook">which meets in the War Room. &nbsp;The War Room is the nerve center of the entire
					<span class="A-notbbc">House</span> Military.&nbsp;</span> Every active House is represented on the War Council. The Master has known some
				members of the War Council for several life-times.&nbsp; House Arpexia, Xianthellipse, and Mirraflex are all members
				of the House Military.&nbsp; Most Time Lords view the House of Mirraflex as being dangerously out of control.&nbsp; Time
				Lords of these Houses will often wear ceremonial battle forms to major official events.&nbsp;</span>
			<span class="A-notbbc">The Time Lords prefer to use and diplomats to gain allies to fight for them in the war.&nbsp;</span>
			<span class="A-notbbc">
			</span>
			<span class="A-audiobook">By this point Gallifreyan Civil Servants have a psychic tripwire that cause death by psychic seizures if they try to reveal

			<span class="A-notbbc">Paradox Anxiety (the fear that one is trapped in a paradox) is now a major problem among the Time Lords and </span>
			<span class="A-notbbc">Temporal Vaccinations have become very popular. &nbsp;</span>
			<span class="A-notbbc">All nonmilitary research missions have been suspended.&nbsp;
				<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Very few members of the
				House Military appear to be remotely humanoid. &nbsp;To combat paradox anxiety, and other stresses of the War, troops,
				agents, and officers are given the ability to reboot their personality to an earlier state of being.&nbsp; This is done
				by overlaying a previously saved personality matrix on the mind of the psychologically disabled individual.&nbsp; Though
				common among the Regen-Inf, the Time Lords rarely use these devices, claiming to be above psychological disturbance.
				&nbsp;</span>
			<span class="A-notbbc">At this point almost all off-world Time Lords are either classified as Field Agents or they are assigned to Boundary Posts.
				<span class="A-fanon">&nbsp;Their battle cry is "Prydon, Rassilon, and Gallifrey!"</span> &nbsp;There are more 103-Forms in use then any other
				type/form of TARDIS.&nbsp; There are at least 59 time-fleets, all numbered.&nbsp; It is not hard for a moderately sized

				but a break through is expected.
				<span class="A-game"> (By the end of they Time War they won't have reach&nbsp;the Type 110)&nbsp;</span> The Type 91 is the only other TARDIS

			<span class="A-notbbc">Some claim that each Homeworld has more defense systems then it has inhabitants. </span>
			<span class="A-notbbc">Even for timeships that have permission to approach, the space-time course through all the defenses of the Home World
				is very complicated.&nbsp; Under most circumstances homeworld security must have a biodata extract from a potential visitor

			<span class="A-notbbc">Due to the time active nature of the War both sides have all the pre-planning time they require.</span>

			&nbsp;The Enemy (and probably the Time Lords) can detect any incursion into N-Space by time travelers at a tactically
				important world. &nbsp;</span>
			<span class="A-audiobook">99% of the Time War involves deception and camouflage

				A more complex tactic is to plant false history records to thwart the above tactic.</span>
			<span class="A-audiobook">
&nbsp;A significant tool in the War are Ur-Boxes. &nbsp;They broadcast
signals into the Vortex that present a set pre-recorded events over a
localized area. &nbsp;Any time scanner that tunes into that time zone
will see history unfolding as presented in the pre-recorded files,
when, in reality, interventionists can be undertaking a mission to
alter events. &nbsp;The range of a Ur-Box is limited to less then a
mile, which can require that the unit to physically re-enact certain
nearby events to maintain the illusion. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</span>

			<span class="A-notbbc">&nbsp;The intricacies of the Labyrinth are so well know that both the Time Lords and the Enemy take to destroying any
