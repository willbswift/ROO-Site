			<h2>THE HISTORY OF THE TIME LORDS PART IV: PRE-CLASSICIAL GALLIFREY
				<br>The Doctor - The Gallifrey Years</h2>
			<div class="section">
				<p>
					<span class="A-fanon">This Time Line covers the life of the Doctor before the Classic TV series. It ranges from his looming to the point where
						he becomes a renegade. It is set 2,000,000 years after Rassilon assumes power on Gallifrey (based off the Infinity
						Doctors and Taking of Planet Five). All dates are given in Gallifreyan years (which are the same as Earth years) and
						are based off the age of the Doctor. </span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span class="A-fanon">Once the Eye of Harmony is anchored, time began moving at a different speed on Gallifrey then the rest of the Universe.
						The Doctor was born around March 30th, 1213 AD and when Greyjan had served one year as President of Gallifrey (and
						the Doctor was 753), the Earth date was 1752 AD. It should also be noted that this differential isn't constant, but
						is slowing by about 1 second every hour (so about 1 year for ever 3,600 years). </span>

				<span class="A-fanon"> (Courtesy of Alexander Dante): A catabolism is a metabolic reaction which usually occurs when the body is unable to properly
					utilize nutrients and breaks down some of its more complex substances (such as muscle) to generate ATP&nbsp; which in
					turn produces a high-energy charge used for other metabolic processes such as anabolism. A severe catabolism could cover
					anything from loss of bone density to reduced organic function. Presumably we are talking about a brain catabolism,
					ie. the conversion of brain tissue into ATP.

centuries of debate on what to do with the cargo of the Consolidator it
was decided that the station should be sent through a time rift into
Gallifrey’s distant future so that future generations of Time Lords to
decide its fate.&nbsp; But not even the most senior Time Lords could
generate a time rift large enough to hold the Consolidator.&nbsp;
Eventually the Doctor and Master, two of the Academy’s most promising
graduates, were asked to find a solution.&nbsp; After a great deal of
work the Doctor pronounced the problem insolvable, but the Master had a
sudden flash of insight that allowed him to see the true nature of time
in a way that his peers had never conceived of.&nbsp; He realizes that
the collapse of a super massive star would create the necessary charge,
angular momentum, and Hawking temperature to forge a stable time
corridor.&nbsp; The Master offered the Doctor the chance to share
credit for his discovery the Doctor refused, believing that the Time
Lords were behaving irresponsibly by pawning the Consolidator off on
future generations.&nbsp; The High Council approved the Master’s plan
and awarded him the highest academic merit.&nbsp; The High Council saw
the Doctor as a disappointment and this created a sense of inadequacy
that nag at the Doctor until his third incarnation and beyond.&nbsp; </span>
