			<h2>THE HISTORY OF THE TIME LORDS PART VIII: THE POST WAR ERA
				<br>The Last of the Time Lords and Gallifrey's Return</h2>
			<div class="section">
				<p>
					<span class="A-fanon">This Time Line covers the life of the Doctor in the new TV series era. It stars at the end of the Time War with the
						9th Doctor and goes until the end of the Universe. All dates are given in Gallifreyan years (which are the same as
						Earth years) and are based off the age of the Doctor. The AF Numbers in Parenthesis refer to the Doctor's age in the
						New TV Series, as quoted in"Aliens of London" and other new stories. </span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span class="A-fanon">There
is an age discrepancy due to the 9th Doctor giving his age at the time
of his regeneration as being about 800 years old. Yet the 6th Doctor
was 953 years old when he regenerated. This contradiction might best be
explained by the Doctor's rebirth/resurrection with a new body in the
City of the Saved after his death a the start of the Time War. For the
purposes of this website, I'm assuming that these new, lower numbers,
represents his age since his resurrection in the City of the Saved and
have used that conclusion for my calculations of dates. From this point
forward I will note the New Series version of the Doctor's age in
parenthesis with an AF (After the Founding of the City), along with the
Doctor's actual age. </span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span class="A-fanon">(Alternately, since people age slower when on board the TARDIS, this new lower age might be his correct age when all
						"of time and space" is taken into account. But it seems unlikely that there would be this much distortion.) </span>

The Doctor uses the TARDIS to expose all of the History to the
undamaged space-time within the Pandorica. &nbsp;This rebooted the
Universe and restored all of the lost events. &nbsp;All of the events
that were caused by the cracks were altered or removed entirely in this

in the Universe <span class="A-game"> - including the one in Cardiff. &nbsp;</span>The remains of one of these cracks will be found on Trenzalore and will be

station time scoops the Doctor and dematerializes with the Master and
Inquisitor Darkel still on board. The Doctor discovers that the brain
patterns of the Time Lords who were executed on the station live on in
an Adjunct to the Matrix that is installed on the station. One of these
deceased Time Lords has escaped the Adjunct and is navigating the
station into Dalek territory. In exchange for providing the station,
and the Doctor to the Daleks, the renegade brain pattern hopes to get
the Daleks to clone him a new body. The Doctor discovers the Valeyard
is still alive and the two of them have to work together to regain
control of the station. </span>

					<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Coalition of the Temporal Powers is formed with the Archetryx
					Convention. &nbsp;Among its members are the Time Lords, the Monan Host, the Nekkistani, the Warpsmiths of Phaidon, Unvoss,
					Virgoans, and Humanity. The Coalition is based on the agreement that as long as the other powers limit their time travel
					technology development the Time Lords will defend them from all temporal attacks. Time Technology Assessors (made up
					of representatives of several members) are authorized to investigate any alleged temporal advancements. &nbsp;Independently

					Category Kappa Sigma 4 (aka the Enclave of Gryben) is modified by the Time Lords so that almost any TT Capsule that

Crunch.&nbsp; Their plan is to create the perfect, all knowing,

this life-form.&nbsp; Kirith is located in Galaxy QSO 0046 at the edge

it convinced the people of 1990s Earth that it was a quasar.&nbsp; Once
this life-form reached the Omega Point it would know everything and
would be omnipotent.&nbsp; Unknown to the Panjistri, their Grand
