			<h2>THE HISTORY OF THE TIME LORDS PART III: MIDDLE GALLIFREY
				<br>The Time of the "Morbius" Doctors</h2>
			<div class="section">
				<p>
					<span class="A-fanon">This Time Line covers the period leading up to the Doctor's birth, which occurs approximately 2,000,000 years after
						Rassilon assumed power on Gallifrey (based off The Infinity Doctors and The Gallifrey Chronicles). All dates are given
						in Gallifreyan years (which are the same as Earth years) and are based off the looming of the William Hartnell Doctor,
						hence they are all negative. </span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span class="A-fanon">Once the Eye of Harmony is anchored, time began moving at a different speed on Gallifrey then the rest of the Universe.
						The Doctor was born around March 30th, 1213 AD and when Greyjan had served one year as President of Gallifrey (and
						the Doctor was 753), the Earth date was 1752 AD. It should also be noted that this differential isn't constant, but
						is slowing by about 1 second every hour (so about 1 year for ever 3,600 years). </span>

					<h2>The "Morbius" Doctors</h2>
					<span class="A-fanon">The mystery of the Morbius Doctors is a tricky problem. They appear to exist before the Doctor left Gallifrey, and yet
						the Doctor and most (if not all) Time Lords regard the Hartnell Doctor as the Doctor's first body. It is know that
						the Doctor was married to Patience for much of time he spent in these lost incarnations, and that both he and his sons
						served on the High Council. It is also known that the Doctor had not regenerated and had no interested in romance when
						he turned 200 at the Academy. In order to get married and have a son that served on the high Council it would seem
						likely that the Doctor would be at least 330 when he was in the Camfield body. However the Doctor's leaving Gallifrey
						would have had to occur at this point. For now I'm assuming that the Morbius Doctor's were a reincarnation of the Other
						that occurred shortly before the birth of the Hartnell Doctor. He married Patience, raised a family and the Doctor
						(and his son) served on the High Council. When the Council discovered that the Doctor having naturally born children
						the Watch attacked and the family was scattered. After experiencing at least 8 incarnations the Other Jumps Looms (ie
						enters the loom distributor and was woven into the biodata of the Hartnell Doctor), who was conceived with the help
						of the Loom of Lungbarrow. Thus the Hartnell (and all subsequent Doctors) are a mix of the Other, the Morbius Doctors,
						and the half human half Gallifreyan conceived by Ulysses and Penelope. </span>
