			<h2>THE CAPITOL OF GALLIFREY</h2>
			<div class="section">
				<span class="A-tv">Several Time Lords use the word Gallifrey to indicate the Capitol (and not Gallifrey in general) so the Capitol's real
					name might be Gallifrey.
					<span class="A-notbbc">Some very unreliable sources call it Sage City.</span> But it is almost always called "the Capitol." The Capitol is</span>
				<span class="A-infinity"> in the Northern Hemisphere </span>
				<span class="A-tv">in </span>
				<span class="A-licensed">the heart of </span>
				<span class="A-tv">the continent of Wild Endeavor and sits in the valley between snow the capped mountains of Solace and Solitude. These
					are part of a
					<span class="A-audiobook">desert </span>mountain range</span>
				<span class="A-tv"> that stretches to the horizon. </span>
				<span class="A-audiobook">The massive Mount Cadon dwarfs the Capitol.
					<span class="A-tv">The only thing that grows on these mountains a deep red grass. </span>
				</span>
				<span class="A-audiobook">During the time of the Pythia there was a volcanic chasm beneath the Capitol known as the Crevasse of Memories That Will
					Be.</span>
				<span class="A-fanon">This might have been where the Untempered Schism had been for billions of years. </span>
				<span class="A-tv">In the modern era the Schism is located outside the Capitol. Rassilon redesigned the rest of the Capitol </span>
				<span class="A-audiobook">after coming to power. The Capitol used to have a harbor </span>
				<span class="A-fanon">(but the oceans receded). </span>
				<span class="A-audiobook">The Kasterborous Borealis can be seen from the Capitol, as can Mount Cadon. The Capitol might suffer from a bitter wind
					from the Northern Lakes. </span>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<span class="A-game">By Human standards the Capitol doesn't appear to be that large of a city, but
					<span class="A-audiobook">the dimensionally transcendental nature of a few of its buildings</span> makes </span>
				<span class="A-game">it the biggest and </span>
				<span class="A-infinity">most heavily populated city on the planet.
					<span class="A-game">Over half the planet's population</span>
					<span class="A-audiobook"> (at least several thousand, </span>
					<span class="A-game">probably several million) </span>
				</span>
				<span class="A-audiobook">live in the Capitol and </span>
				<span class="A-tv">many Time Lords never leave the Capitol. A large glass dome covers the Capitol. </span>
				<span class="A-audiobook">Gallifrey </span>
				<span class="A-fanon"> (the Capitol?)</span>
				<span class="A-audiobook"> smells of cloisters, libraries, vellum, and old excitonic circuitry. Candles are very common. Most of the walls in the
					Citadel appear to be made of stone with dim green light leaking out from the cracks in the aging walls. Unused corridors
					are filled with dust. The architecture is filled with alcoves. </span>
				<span class="A-alternate">The strong and ridged gravinium is the most common building material on Gallifrey. </span>
				<span class="A-tv">They often to use the valuable brass-like Machenite as the building material of choice for the interior of important
					rooms. Lead is not a common building material and few on Gallifrey are trained in its manipulation.&nbsp;</span><span class="A-audiobook">The decor of the Capitol<span class="A-fanon"> </span>can be changed in the same way that a TARDIS’s desk-top theme can be changed. <br></span>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<span class="A-tv">In the center of the Capitol (beneath the apex of the dome) is a structure known as the Citadel (see below). </span>
				<span class="A-game">Many of the surrounding towers are helical in design. </span>
				<span class="A-audiobook">A small conventional spaceport can be found near the Citadel (probably the Desiree Spaceport). Time Scaphs are docked
					the Scaph Port. Scientific research is done in the Penansulix Scientific Structure.
					<span class="A-game">Gallifreyan</span> laboratories include everything from
					<span class="A-game">cross-dimensional wave</span> scanners to test tubes and Bunsen burners. The Parachronistic Chamber (located deep in
					the Capitol) can regulate time distortions. In addition to </span>
				<span class="A-audiobook">Tower Gamma 6 and Tower Alpha 7, there are two huge towers in the north of the Capitol named Canoncity and Likelihood.
					Both of these building are among the few that are dimensionally transcendental. </span>
				<span class="A-fanon"> The tower of Likelihood might be home to the </span>
				<span class="A-audiobook">Bureau of Possible Events. </span>
				<span class="A-tv">A famously effective polygonal Zero Room can be found in the basement of the Junior Senate Block. </span>
				<span class="A-audiobook">Time Lords meet in the Artron Forum to telepathically discuss and exchange points of view. While meeting their excess
					artron energy is absorbed and routed to the berthing bays to supply TARDISes. Other buildings include the Capitol Library,
					<span class="A-licensed">the Mortal Coil </span>hospital complex of the Hospitaller-surgeons, Retro-Engineered Spare-Body-Parts Repository, the
					Meditative Sanctums of Astral Harmony, the Temandra Pleasure Gardens, Gesyevva's Fingers (colonnades), </span>
				<span class="A-alternate">Bureau of Political Advancement, The Temple of Capitol Guilds, the Office of Public Registry, </span>
				<span class="A-game">and numerous massive workshops. </span>
				<span class="A-audiobook">Gardens are contained in their own glass domes. Only a few of the buildings in the Capitol are dimensionally transcendental.
					The capitol is broken up into numbered sectors and all the rooms are numbered (example Room 30007 in the Administrative
					Complex). Council </span>
				<span class="A-tv">members use air-cars to get around the Capitol. </span>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<span class="A-tv">The 53 story Communications Tower is in Sector 7 (just outside the Capitol). </span>
				<span class="A-audiobook">Beneath the upper levels of the Capitol is MidTown which has a Multi-Dimensional Art Gallery (filled with vast numbers
					of computer created paintings from throughout Gallifrey's history). The streets of the Capitol City are patrolled by
					</span>
				<span class="A-notbbc"> automated street cleaning mechanisms. </span>
				<span class="A-game">Life support for the Capitol is provided my huge recycling systems, such as</span>
				<span class="A-audiobook">tachyonic recreation fabricators to create physical materials, and the Main Water Pumping Station in the vaults of the
					Citadel. Half a mile
					<span class="A-tv">beneath the Capitol is the city's foundations, the remains of the original Capitol, </span>and LowTown. The slums of
					Low Town (sometimes call New Town) are made up of the society of poor that has formed in the foundations of the Capitol.
					</span>
				<span class="A-audiobook"> Hidden in the lower levels are
					<span class="A-alternate"> cisterns and</span> a shrines dedicated to the cult of Rassilon the Vampire. Buried deep underground are fallout shelters
					and Catacombs whose total length (if arranged end to end) would exceed the diameter of Gallifrey. It would take modern
					Time Lords thousands of years to rebuild the entire Capitol, and re-create the transduction barriers. </span>

						grew to be a very powerful organization. </span>
					<span class="A-notbbc">The CIA is the most influential of the interventionist movement and believes that the Web of Time should be adjusted

					<span class="A-audiobook">They even have the ability to freeze time on Gallifrey. Typical Time Lord weapons don’t need to be fired, instead
						they affect everything within a certain area. </span>
					<span class="A-game">The CIA will enclose their labs in recursive time loops to hide them from Time Lord society. </span>
