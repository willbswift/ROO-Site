			<h2>THE CAPITOL OF GALLIFREY</h2>
			<div class="section">
				<p>
				<span class="A-licensed">The Capitol is considered to be Gallifrey's First City. </span><span class="A-tv">Several Time Lords use the word Gallifrey to indicate the Capitol (and not the planet in general).
					<span class="A-licensed">Its official name is Capitol City, </span><span class="A-notbbc">but some very unreliable sources call it Sage City. </span>Most Gallifreyans simply refer to it as "the Capitol." 
				</span></p>	
				<p> 
					<span class="A-tv">The Capitol is</span>
				<span class="A-infinity"> in the Northern Hemisphere </span>
				<span class="A-tv">in </span>
				<span class="A-licensed">the wastelands at the heart of </span>
				<span class="A-tv">the
continent of Wild Endeavor. It sits in the valley between snow the
capped mountains of Solace and Solitude. These are part of a <span class="A-audiobook">desert </span>mountain range</span>
				<span class="A-tv"> that stretches to the horizon. </span>
				<span class="A-audiobook">The massive Mount Cadon dwarfs the Capitol.
					<span class="A-tv">The only thing that grows on these mountains a deep red grass. </span>
				</span>
				<span class="A-audiobook">During the time of the Pythia there was a volcanic chasm running through the Capitol known as the Crevasse of Memories That Will
					Be.</span><span class="A-licensed"> In modern times, the</span><span class="A-fanon"><span class="A-licensed"> Crevasse is located outside the Capitol.</span> This might have been where the Untempered Schism had been for billions of years.&nbsp;</span><span class="A-tv">Rassilon redesigned the rest of the Capitol </span>
				<span class="A-audiobook">after coming to power.</span><span class="A-tv"></span><span class="A-audiobook"> </span><span class="A-tv">In the modern era the Schism is located outside the Capitol. </span><span class="A-audiobook">The Capitol used to have a harbor </span>
				<span class="A-fanon">(but the oceans receded). </span>
				<span class="A-audiobook">The Kasterborous Borealis can be seen from the Capitol, as can Mount Cadon. The Capitol might suffer from a bitter wind
					from the Northern Lakes<span class="A-licensed"> and was covered in snow for much of the year. </span></span>
				</p>
				<span class="A-game">By Human standards the Capitol doesn't appear to be that large of a city, but
					<span class="A-audiobook">the dimensionally transcendental nature of a few of its buildings</span> makes </span>
				<span class="A-game">it the biggest and </span>
				<span class="A-infinity">most heavily populated city on the planet.
					<span class="A-game">Over half the planet's population </span>
					<span class="A-audiobook">(at least several thousand, </span>

floor plates have titanium rivets.&nbsp;Most of the walls in the
Citadel appear to be made of stone with dim green light leaking out
from the cracks in the aging walls. Unused corridors are filled with
dust. The architecture is filled with fountains and alcoves. There are
also many gardens with their own domes. </span><span class="A-audiobook">The decor of the Capitol<span class="A-fanon"> </span>can be changed in the same way that a TARDIS’s desk-top theme can be changed. </span><span class="A-tv">They

of choice for the interior of important rooms.&nbsp;</span><span class="A-audiobook">The streets of the Capitol are patrolled by </span>

				<span class="A-audiobook">Council </span>
				<span class="A-tv">members use<span class="A-audiobook"> transtubes and</span> air-cars to get around the Capitol,<span class="A-licensed">
but there are at least 49 metal doored External Gates that alow one to
exit&nbsp;the Capitol at ground level (most of which haven't been
opened in a century). </span></span><span class="A-audiobook">A small conventional spaceport can be found<span class="A-licensed"> just outside</span> the Capitol dome (probably the Desiree Spaceport). Time Scaphs can be found docked the Scaph Port. </span>

				<span class="A-audiobook">The capitol is broken up into <span class="A-licensed">6 </span>numbered sectors and all the rooms are numbered (example Room 30007 in the Administrative Complex<span class="A-fanon"> - probably Sector 3). <span class="A-licensed"></span></span></span><span class="A-tv"><span class="A-licensed">Sectors 1-6 designate the Great Citadel and the High City towers attached to and protruding from the conical base of that

statue. This bankrupted the Scendeles College. The Hall of Rassilon
