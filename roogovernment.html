			<h2>THE CAPITOL OF GALLIFREY</h2>
			
			
			
			<div class="section">
				<span class="A-tv"><span class="A-licensed">The Capitol is considered to be Gallifrey's First City. </span>Several Time Lords use the word Gallifrey to indicate the Capitol (and not the planet in general).
					<span class="A-licensed">Its official name is Capitol City, </span><span class="A-notbbc">but some very unreliable sources call it Sage City.</span> <br>Most Gallifreyans simply refer to it as "the Capitol." The Capitol is</span>
				<span class="A-infinity"> in the Northern Hemisphere </span>
				<span class="A-tv">in </span>
				<span class="A-licensed">the wastelands at the heart of </span>
				<span class="A-tv">the continent of Wild Endeavor. It sits in the valley between snow the capped mountains of Solace and Solitude. These
					are part of a
					<span class="A-audiobook">desert </span>mountain range</span>
				<span class="A-tv"> that stretches to the horizon. </span>
				<span class="A-audiobook">The massive Mount Cadon dwarfs the Capitol.
					<span class="A-tv">The only thing that grows on these mountains a deep red grass. </span>
				</span>
				<span class="A-audiobook">During the time of the Pythia there was a volcanic chasm running through the Capitol known as the Crevasse of Memories That Will
					Be.</span><span class="A-licensed"> In modern times, the</span><span class="A-fanon"><span class="A-licensed"> Crevasse is located outside the Capitol.</span> This might have been where the Untempered Schism had been for billions of years.&nbsp;</span><span class="A-tv">Rassilon redesigned the rest of the Capitol </span>
				<span class="A-audiobook">after coming to power.</span><span class="A-tv"></span><span class="A-audiobook"> </span><span class="A-tv">In the modern era the Schism is located outside the Capitol. </span><span class="A-audiobook">The Capitol used to have a harbor </span>
				<span class="A-fanon">(but the oceans receded). </span>
				<span class="A-audiobook">The Kasterborous Borealis can be seen from the Capitol, as can Mount Cadon. The Capitol might suffer from a bitter wind
					from the Northern Lakes<span class="A-licensed"> and was&nbsp; covered in snow for much of the year.</span></span><span class="A-game"><span class="A-licensed"> 
				</span><br><br>By Human standards the Capitol doesn't appear to be that large of a city, but
					<span class="A-audiobook">the dimensionally transcendental nature of a few of its buildings</span> makes </span>
				<span class="A-game">it the biggest and </span>
				<span class="A-infinity">most heavily populated city on the planet.
					<span class="A-game">Over half the planet's population </span>
					<span class="A-audiobook">(at least several thousand, </span>
					<span class="A-game">probably several million) </span>

made of stone with dim green light leaking out from the cracks in the
aging walls. Unused corridors are filled with dust. The architecture is
filled with alcoves. </span><span class="A-audiobook">The decor of the Capitol<span class="A-fanon"> </span>can be changed in the same way that a TARDIS’s desk-top theme can be changed. </span><span class="A-tv">They

				<span class="A-tv">members use air-cars to get around inside the Capitol,<span class="A-licensed">
but there the only exits from the dome are from a few metal doors at
ground level (most of which haven't been opened in a century). </span></span><span class="A-audiobook"></span><span class="A-audiobook">A small conventional spaceport can be found<span class="A-licensed"> just outside</span> the Capitol dome (probably the Desiree Spaceport).

				<br>
				<span class="A-audiobook">The capitol is broken up into numbered sectors and all the rooms are numbered (example Room 30007 in the Administrative Complex<span class="A-fanon"> - probably Sector 3). &nbsp;<span class="A-licensed">Each of these Sectors is described below. </span></span></span>

it is known that Rassilon's statue is in the north, while Omega's was
on the south side of the room. There was a competition to see which
College could build the biggest statue. This bankrupted the Scendeles
College. The Hall of Rassilon leads up to the Panoptican. This hall is
filled with 'regenerating' statues of important Time Lords, like
Apeiron, Mutanioa, Omega, Pandak, Pandak IV, Pandak XX, and Rassilon. <span class="A-licensed">On
either side of the main entrance are antechambers were the ceromonial
