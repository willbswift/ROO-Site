				<h2>SHOBOGANS (Pre-Curse Gallifreyans)</h2>
				<div class="section">
					<span class="A-audiobook">The first Neanderthal Gallifreyans evolved </span>
					<span class="A-fanon"> about 10 million years before the time of Rassilon. </span>
					<span class="A-audiobook">They
are the first sentient humanoids to appear in the Universe. As such
their morphic fields increase the chances of humanoids evolving on
other planets. <span class="A-tv">These Gallifreyan
							<span class="A-audiobook">Neanderthals</span> did not evolve from anything
							<span class="A-audiobook">embarrassing</span> (like apes or monkeys). </span>
						<span class="A-fanon">Given
the vast similarities to Gallifrey and Alzarius its possible that they
might have evolved from something similar to the Marshmen of that
world. </span></span>
					<span class="A-audiobook">The Constructors of Destiny modify the Gallifreyan Neanderthals to fulfill their destiny. </span><span class="A-fanon">This </span><span class="A-tv">exposure to the Untempered Schism, over billions of years of evolution, allows the Gallifreyans to become sensitive to time </span><span class="A-audiobook">and
its movement. A common side effect of a species living next to a
wormhole over a few centuries is that the populace will develop psionic
powers. Such exposure can also cause rapid mutations (again, like the
marshmen of Alzarius). </span><span class="A-tv">This new species called themselves the Shobogans. </span>

had the same resistance to being frozen solid that modern Gallifreyans

distinctly different from modern Gallifreyans. </span>

					<span class="A-audiobook">
						<span class="A-tv">While a young (around 16), a Gallifreyan’s telepathic powers are still developing</span> and they are vulnerable

					<span class="A-licensed"> The official documents and records stated that</span><span class="A-audiobook"> Shobogans </span><span class="A-licensed">had a normal life-span of 300 years and </span><span class="A-audiobook">had no chance of living more then a few centuries. </span>
					<span class="A-tv">Without
the regenerative powers of modern Gallifreyans, a Gallifreyan would be
confined to wheelchairs before they reached 200 years old. If their
life was prolonged 700 years beyond that point the subject's body would
atrophie until he's only a few feet tall. </span>
					<span class="A-licensed">The bodies of the dead were usualy burned in a pyre.</span>

Shobogans that were given the Timeless Child's gift of unlimited
regeneration were could live forever if they avoided accidents.</span>

could be because the Pythias had access to the elixier of Karn, or
perhapse they too had received the gift of unlimited regenerations. </span></span>

					<span class="A-audiobook">By human standards Shobogans were
						<span class="A-game">stronger,</span> more athletic, and </span>
					<span class="A-audiobook">significantly
taller then an average human. The Shobogan women tended to be much
taller then Shobogan males (this changed after when the looms began
creating modern Gallifreyans). The women also tended to have well
developed muscles. </span>
					<span class="A-tv">While the Shobogans lacked the regenerative powers of modern Gallifreyans, </span><span class="A-audiobook">it
is know that they were much more powerful telepaths, and the adult
minds of the planet were in constant telepathic entrelacement due to an
organ located in their hypothalamus. This was thought to be the
greatest curse of Shobogan civilization. </span><span class="A-fanon">It is possible they might have had the telepathic, adaptive, and healing abilities similar to the Marshmen from Alzarius.</span>
				</div>
				<div class="section">
					<span class="A-audiobook">Approximately
every 1,000 years a Shobogan was born who could shield their minds from
telepathy and had more psionic powers. They were known as Individuals </span><span class="A-game">and they had powers and abilities that, in the modern era, are considered to be nothing buy myth and superstitions. </span>			
					<span class="A-audiobook">Some were powerful seers and visionaries </span>
					<span class="A-licensed">and many had telekinetic powers. </span>	
					<span class="A-audiobook">When children, Individuals also made good time pilots. </span><span class="A-fanon">Because of their ability to focus </span><span class="A-game">older Individuals often became great philosophers, scientists, and explorers. Many became Heroes. </span>

					<span class="A-audiobook">The ancient Shobogans would be virtually extinct

after the last Pythia cursed the entire species with sterility.
Fortunately, by that point, Rassilon and his followers had developed an
alternative means of reproduction. Over time the term Shobogans became
slang for any Gallifreyan who rejects the traditions and culture of
Rassilon’s Time Lords.</span>
