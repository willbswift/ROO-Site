			<h2>THE RASSILON ERA</h2>
			<div class="section">
				<span class="A-audiobook">According
to "Christmas on a Rational Planet" Eye of Harmony was anchored around
3,500,000,000 BC. Once this happens, time begins moving at a different
speed on Gallifrey then it does the rest of the Universe - around 5
times as fast to begin with. But the differential isn't constant, it is
slowing by about 1 second every hour. The Doctor was born around March
30th, 1213 AD </span><span class="A-notbbc">and when Greyjan had served one year as President of Gallifrey (and the Doctor was 753), the Earth date was 1752 AD.</span>

							<span class="A-fanon">As part of the defense mechanisms these other Gallifreys appear not be connected with the Protocols of Linearity (aka
							the 3rd Law of Time). Indeed it is possible that a new Law of Time was passed to prevent each Gallifrey's causal nexus
							from interacting directly with the others. This would mean that any enemy who engaged one of the cloneworlds who then
							be trapped by the Protocols of Linearity making it very difficult for them to mount an attack on any other Gallifrey
							(or their agents). Any Time Lord who survived their Gallifrey's destruction would only be able to visit worlds which
							either had no connection with the War or worlds where it was believed that Gallifrey had fallen. Effectively they would
							be stranded in the Post Time War era. This is exactly what we see in the 8th Doctor after The Ancestor Cell. Though
							the 8th Doctor was able to get back into the Pre-Time War era, both after the events of Taking of Planet 5 and again

ancestors of the Killer Cats were the Felinetta cat-people. They are
born in litters, and the females were much smarter then that males. The
Cat-People had very good night vision and sense of smell, but they hate
water.

CAT's instinctive precognitive powers allow it to sense what is
possible and what is impossible. The CATs could thus prevent inventors
