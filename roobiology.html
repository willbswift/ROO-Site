					<span class="A-notbbc">most have almost no sex drive.
						<span class="A-audiobook"> Many, like </span>
						<span class="A-tv">the Doctor, live most of their lives in celibacy. </span></span></span><span class="A-audiobook">For these reasons, each Chapterhouse has one Genetic Loom with a unique genetic core to loom its cousins. </span>
				<span class="A-notbbc">Each Chapterhouse has a loomshed, which holds the House’s Loom. </span>
				<span class="A-audiobook"> Every Gallifreyan is born into one of Rassilon’s Great Houses and the Honorable Central Population Directory defines
					the quota of cousins for each House's Loom. </span>
				<span class="A-game">This directory is directly controlled by the High Council.</span>
				<span class="A-audiobook">In the pre-Time War era there are between 3 and 9 million Gallifreyans living on the planet. </span>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<span class="A-audiobook">A loom consists of millions of fine cords which </span>
				<span class="A-notbbc">weave matter (probably rapid growth biomass) and biodata together. A new loom probably takes over 11 years to produce
					its first loomling. </span>
				<span class="A-audiobook">The Looms are held in the loomshed of the&nbsp;physical house. Each House's loom has its own Loom core, which serves as
					its genius loci. This creates a template that standardizes the abilities
					<span class="A-alternate">and blood </span>of everyone loomling of that family. </span>
				<span class="A-notbbc">Members of each house have minor variations in abilities unique to their house. </span>
				<span class="A-alternate">An experienced vampire can tell which house a Gallifreyan came from by the taste of their blood. </span>
				<span class="A-audiobook">The loom weaves a random body based on that House's basic, but unique, template. Thus there is no way for someone to
					control the appearance of a new child<span class="A-notbbc">e.
						<span class="A-tv">So while the chances of a duplicate regeneration is relatively high,

				<span class="A-infinity">Just over 10% of loomlings are female. </span>
				<span class="A-notbbc">The Looms are complex anchors in time designed to link the Gallifreyan to Gallifrey and, by extension, the Web of Time.
				</span>
				<span class="A-notbbc">As such they have limited knowledge of the future of every loomling.
					<span class="A-audiobook">A loom automatically record the genetic metamorphosis every time one of its cousins regenerates. </span>
				</span>
				<span class="A-notbbc">They probably weave not only DNA but also give each loomling a distinct future. </span>
				<span class="A-audiobook">For several days spirals of data flow down these cords and are woven into a mesh. From this mesh a Gallifreyan
					<span class="A-notbbc">Childe</span> is formed within a tube. During this time </span>
				<span class="A-audiobook">Loom-Tenders supervise and occasionally sing traditional rhymes. </span>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<span class="A-audiobook">Depending on the programing that house's loom core, some looms
					<span class="A-tv">produce offspring in the form of a small child<span class="A-notbbc">e</span> (reminiscent of a human child)</span>, but most loomlings emerge as full grown adults. </span>

			<h2>GALLIFREYAN PSIONICS</h2>
			<div class="section">
				<span class="A-audiobook">It
took several generations of genetic engineering to re-introduce psychic
abilities to the loom born Gallifreyans, but in the modern era, all
Gallifreyans are psychic (Though some have greater psionic sensitivity
then others). The Epiphysis Cerebri (pineal gland)‎‎ on a Gallifreyan is
twice the size of a humans. It is sometimes known as the Third Eye and
is the part of the brain that is the source of psychic activity.
Gallifreyan psionics work via neural congruence and sympathetic
resonance. Gallifreyans suffer psychic feedback, fever and headaches as
their telepathic abilities mature. Whenever two Gallifreyans meet there
is a courtesy mind-touch to identify and acknowledge each other. Since
every Gallifreyan has a unique psycho-kinetic signature, this allows</span>
				<span class="A-tv"> them to recognize each other even if they are wearing a new body. </span>

Gallifreyans can temporarily swap psychic mind-scents with someone else

a Gallifreyan could regenerate and find himself to be half human. It is
also possible for them to regenerated in an animal like a talking dog

genetics during aregeneration can leave the subject with unstable DNA
leading to cellular degradation. This requires frequent consumption of
the <span class="A-fanon">artron</span> life energy of others to survive, but with each live consumed the period of stability shortens.</span> Other
legends tell of regenerations that had only regenerated half of the
body (which can happen if the subject regenerates in a strong time
dilation field), regenerations where the body was changed but not the
brain,
regenerations that turned the subject inside out, regenerations that
reverted the Gallifreyan into a time-tot and other monstrous
variations. There are rumors and heresies that, at one point in
Gallifrey's history, a Shadow House existed which would hold
Gallifreyans whose regenerations have failed in some way. These
problems was only corrected within the last several thousand years.
While a majority of Gallifreyans have no real choice over their
appearance, Gallifreyans from Newblood Houses have amazing control over
there regenerations. <span class="A-tv">This allows them to try on several different genetic templates (and appearances) during a regeneration. </span>This

				<span class="A-fanon"> For this reason</span>
				<span class="A-audiobook"> it is usually forbidden for Gallifreyans to regenerate until they are 500 years old. Going through 7 regenerations in

				<span class="A-fanon">During the Time War these law and punishments were removed.</span>
				<span class="A-audiobook">Public discussions of regeneration among Gallifreyans appears to be similar to sex amongst humans (i.e. not good table

using surgery. To do so the relevant chains for each incarnation would
have to be isolated and drawn off – removing that regeneration. This
extracted cycle could then be implanted in a new subject. Some have
