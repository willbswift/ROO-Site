Reaching other galaxies takes Gallifreyan ships centuries or more. The
Leviathan Fleet is filled with generation ships where people live out
multiple generations before the fleet would reach the new galaxy.&nbsp;
But most ships rely on cryogenic caskets to keep the crew alive for the
centuries the trip will take.&nbsp;These ships had their control deck
in the forward section of the ship. Gallifreyans use cybernetic
implants to provide them with instant access to information.
Laser blasters are a common side arm in this era.&nbsp;Captain Glammis
commands the Stellar Fire, which sets out for Andromeda. This is
the fastest ship, yet constructed, and 50 years later it has reached
the frontier worlds of Andromeda.&nbsp; But an engine malfunction
causes the ship to crash. The captain’s brother, Abadon Glammis
eventually becomes the richest person in the Stellian Galaxy (and
several other galaxies as well). He uses his money to assemble a
rescue ship.&nbsp;After 100 years of searching the rescue ship found
the Stellar Fire and saved it’s still frozen crew and captain from the
Wirrn. This story becomes a popular fairtale told to time-tots. &nbsp;</span></span><span class="A-audiobook"></span><span class="A-notbbc"></span><span class="A-audiobook"></span><span class="A-audiobook"></span><span class="A-game"></span><br><p><span class="A-audiobook">??&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

inhabited by Laima, Slots, and the Gallifreyan Clansfolk <span class="A-fanon">(the Tractators who call this world home appear to be ignored).&nbsp;</span>The word "Laimee" means happiness.

theory is also known as the Skasas Paradigm or the God Maker. It
unlocks how the universe works, giving the user complete control of the
basic building blocks of the universe (time, space, matter). </span>
				<span class="A-audiobook">
The Unified Field Theory gave the Laima the ability to travel through
time and to alternate universes. But to traverse these dimensions, they
needed to stop the gravitational constant from decreasing. Desiring to
travel to the next highest Universe (a dimension of Thought), they
create the Gravity Generator Control Unit.&nbsp;</span><span class="A-audiobook">The Laima leave this Universe and the Slots

Gravitational Constant and stabilizes it at 6.672x10^-11 N (m/kg)^2
throughout the universe. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Gravity Generator Control Unit is placed on
Sol III, a world awkwardly placed on one of the arms of Mutter's
Stellian Spiral Galaxy. This world will eventually become known as The
Earth. According to Gallifrey's records, Sol III is one of the only
worlds in the cosmos to
have the word 'the' before its name (ie The Earth). The presence of the
Gravity Control Unit makes physics operate differently around Earth
(this is why it took humans so long time to discover FTL drive). The
world's effect on the laws of physics attracts the attentions of
several other species and serves as a catalyst for the hundreds of
alien invasions that Earth experiences throughout the Humanian Era.
Indeed Earth will become the most frequently attacked, colonized,
exploited, and enslaved world in the 5 Galaxies. <span class="A-licensed"> The Time Lords seen the humans of the Earth as a race of warriors. </span>
The Matrix also predicts that near the end of the Universe (Event 2),
the Time Travel Technology of the Tellurians (Humans), will surpass the
Time Lords. All of this makes Earth an important <span class="A-game">Temporal</span> Nexus World (like Solos, Tylers Folly, <span class="A-game"> and possibly Gallifrey) </span><span class="A-tv"> and its history quickly becomes littered with Fixed Points in time. </span></span>

&nbsp;&nbsp; The Earth's gravity control unit might be buried beneath
the Indian ocean's gravity distortion (this is a real distortion that
cause a deformation in the ocean). Or it might be located at Stonehenge
(where the Monk built a monument) as it was the first place Tanis
seized when he attacked the Earth.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Fury: According to legend, the village of Slothe located in the
foothills near Mount Perdition. Its people hunted and gathered rather
than develop agriculture, and because of this they devastated the
ecology of the region. So the Gallifreyan God, Death sent its
messenger, the Krafayis to the Village. The Krafayis killed all of the
Villagers except for Presus the Indolent, the son of the village Prelate.
An elderly Seer foresaw a time when Gallifreyans would never die.
Presus found the Krafayis and killed it after three days of combat.
Afterwards he burned the bodies of the village and went to sleep.
Having defeated death, he never died but continued to sleep forever
while be watched over by Time. This story would become a Time Lord fairy tale. <span class="A-fanon">Its
possible that these events refer to the Kotturuh bringing the 'gift' of
death to all life in the Universe. Its possible that Pesus might be a
reference to Rassilon who also slept for a billion years after
overcoming death.&nbsp;</span></span></p><p><span class="A-audiobook"><span class="A-licensed"><span class="A-fanon">-110?? &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (possibly after ther 507th Pythia was killed by the Kotturuh??) </span></span></span><span class="A-audiobook">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="dropdown">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span><span class="A-audiobook"><br>
