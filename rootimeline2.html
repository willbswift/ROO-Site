				<br>The Great Days of Rassilon</h2>
			<div class="section">
				<p>
					<span class="A-fanon">This is a Time Line of Ancient Gallifrey. It's dating system is based off the Gallifreyan year (which is the same as
						Earth's). Year Zero is the year that (according to Doctor Who Magazine) Rassilon created the Eye of Harmony. According
						to the FASA Role-Playing Game this happened 23 years after Omega's death. According to"Christmas on a Rational Planet"
						all of this happened around 3,500,000,000 BC. </span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span class="A-fanon">Once the Eye of Harmony is anchored, time begins moving at a different speed on Gallifrey then the rest of the Universe
						- around 5 times as fast to begin with. But the differential isn't constant, it is slowing by about 1 second every
						hour. The Doctor was born around March 30th, 1213 AD and when Greyjan had served one year as President of Gallifrey
						(and the Doctor was 753), the Earth date was 1752 AD. </span>
